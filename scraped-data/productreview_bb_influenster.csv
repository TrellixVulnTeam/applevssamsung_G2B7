galaxy,5,The Samsung Galaxy s9 is arguably the most beautiful phone ever created. Samsung Galaxy S line of phones are world famous for their design and build quality. Holding this phone in your hand is like picking up a device from the future. Battery life is excellent and Samsung's UI and operating system software is getting better with every update. Now that the s10 is out the s9 is getting cheaper.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"great  phone smart features easy to use ,, , plenty of gadgets.. good  phone  camera excellent ..easy to use..light weight..easy load apps..easy to use..easy to  read numbers.. nice colours..will allways stick with a samsung",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,I really liked the phone. It has good camera which is the best feature and it was a good change after using iphone for about a decade. Really recommend it.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,"First of all the camera quality does not disappoint, as are all samsung cameras it is excellent on the S9. I have found the battery doesn't last very long, I have to charge my phone every night, the button below the volume keys for Bixby is a tad annoying or just may take longer to get used to. Overall I have found the s9 To be just as good as my s7 Edge and my rather cheap OPPO.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"As a flagship phone goes, everything is pretty standard. Speed is fast, touch is sensitive, interface is intuitive.I take a lot of photos and while there is no ""portrait mode"", the ""selective focus"" does a good job of creating the bokeh effect. Where the S9 really stands out is the low light photography. I can take sharp photos with accurate white balance in dimly lit restaurants using the auto settings (attached photo taken at night and in the rain). The biggest downside is that even on a normal workday where I don't make extensive use of my phone, the battery only lasts one day on optimised mode.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,"Had Samsung S9 for just over 1 month, battery life barely last 2 days on medium power saving. My Samsung S7 edge had better battery life, I have had an iPhone 7 (work phone) for 18 months, use all day during working hours last at least 3 days. How could you go so wrong samsung. Not happy",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"The camera quality is very good with this phone.  There is no need to buy a separate camera.  The phone is easy to use, apps easily install and I have not had an issue at all with this type of phone.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,Fantastic phone. The camera is great and the screen is gorgeous to look at. Samsung software is easy to use but at times feels like there is too much on that is not needed and makes the phone slower.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"Camera quality is decent, occasionally plays up however most the time works well. Display is fantastic am yet to have a problem with it. Apps and games run smoothly and the built in cache cleaner app is fantastic.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"My New Samsung S9 is my go to girl . I simply could not get through and juggle life without it . From taking photos and capturing memories to appointments for the kids , makes my life easier",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,"Was told the phone is amazing...The camera never focuses, even when using the selective focus setting, it takes the photo but always says could not focus..The battery life is terrible, my husband gets nearly two days from his phone, i get a day if that, i have only been up a hour took it of charge and it is now down to 78% and i havent watched anything just been googling reviews on this phone, and all open apps are closed,Dont like how the screen goes around the sides so brought a phone cover,I wish I stayed with what I had but ohh well",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,The camera is amazing on this phone and the close ups are like looking through a microscope. I cannot fault the camera. I do not like the curved screen and find the edge of the screen too easy to accidentally touch and then start other apps. The finger print scanner is not easy to use on the back and I like it on the front better like with the S7. The sounds are good. I can no longer put a different ring tone on for each contact which seems like a step backwards.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,1,Samsung is crap and cheap phone. I wonder whose stupid idiot made these phone. Always had so many problems whenever I use this crap phone. iPhones are much better and their customer service is best also not like crap Samsung!!!!!,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,Excellent for now - If it starts to degrade like my last Android phone I will update my review to suite.Pros:- The camera is awesome.- I like the different methods of unlocking the phone- It is currently quick and runs smoothly but then so did my Nexus 5 when it was new.- It has fantastic battery life. I spent a good couple of hours the other day watching movies on netflix and realised that I hadn't plugged my phone in. It was only- Transferring my data was made really simple by downloading the Samsung app to do it.- Bizarrely in Jan 19 the 256GB version was cheaper than the 64GB version! Not sure what was going on there but check before you buy!Cons:- The curved screen is a bit of a gimmick. I am so blinking worried that I am going to smash it for the first time ever I have put a protective cover on my phone.- The retina scan makes my eye ache if I use it in a dark room. I have disabled that feature.- Samsung get a bit snotty if you try to switch out their phone dialer and SMS app.- The Samsung keyboard interface is not as good as the stock Google one (There is probably a way to switch).,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"I like this phone.Pros:1. Screen resolution2. Nice camera3. Easy to access apps and other thingsCons:1. When you hold the phone the hand touches the screen, sometimes apps started2. Unhappy with the battery life.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,I'm so happy with the camera on this phone compared to my old apple phone. The processing speed and loading apps is also so much faster. Also so much easier to load photos on and off phone compared to apple. I still love apple TV and wish samsung did a similar thing but I got this phone for a better camera and bigger storage and am absolutely impressed with both.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"MESSAGING AND CALLS. - Very easy to call and to message people. Great controls and a great look. You can even put some contacts on your home screen to all them easily and set some numbers up on speed dial.CAMERA QUALITY - Absolutely amazing. I have a good Canon camera & ""some"" photos I take with my phone, people think I took them with my camera & they become amazed when I tell them, that it's actually my phone. Love using the focus mode and it blurs out the back ground beautifully. Night mode is great when using flash .BATTERY LIFE - Battery has been working fantastic for me!",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,Screen goes all the way to the edge. I don't like that. I kept pressing things by accident. Phone is way to slippery so had to spend 30 dollars on a cover. Bixby is a joke. Should have stuck with the s7. I loved that phone. Wonder if I can find another.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,"Phone is generally good. However, touch screen stopped working only a few months after I bought it, and tech support were not very helpful. Was able to backup and keep files and sent away for a replacement through Optus. Not really a fan of the curved edges, feels like it makes it more prone to damage if there isn't a case.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,Always liked samsungs reliabilty.Though this camera has improved on this model. For me personally its teenybopper gadgets and magic makeup and photoshop selfies & gifs etc make me thinking of ditching it for less hype item sometimes when i accidentally bump something. But most phones are full of the same junk these days. I have a cover on mine so i am actually annoyed the flash doesn't work well because it bounces off edge of coverframe.I chose purple model but with cover noone sees it anyway.  I find it too big and awkward to use easily. I liked the older galaxys with menu 'button' instead of annoying screen pressing everything. And preferred the older shape balance for holding & ease of use especially with camera etc.Overall I dont love it. But i dont hate it either.its reliable quality to me. The ability to night time photograph & the storing of 8000 photos recently helped me realise an upside to it ;)I havent had any issues with it.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Camera is Good if not best available at the moment. Display quality is really good.Apps are really responsive and loved Finger scanner on back side , it's so responsive than my previous S6.So far Best Android Mobile i have Ever used, Battery is reasonable. Loved Dolby Atmos sound in this mobile it really sounds great.Good for Games , great Mobile if you are Android Lover.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,I updated my old Samsung Galaxy s5 for the s9 and so far I am very happy with it. I am only having to charge it every second day which is much better then the daily charging I was needing on my old mobile. The features are easy enough to use and I really like the rose gold coloured.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,1,"My phone was protected with a case and screen protector. Only 3 weeks old my phone was sadly dropped at hip height and I'm no BFG but smash! With almost tears in my eyes as I did everything to protect it and it still smashed I went to the repair shop! Here the tears let go! I was told  by the repairman that the screen protectors dont work well due to curved edges and it will cost me $490 to fix. What the actual fries! NOTHING to do with the repair shops, Price set by samsung! Keep this in mind when purchasing this brand! I am now the owner of a (not a one of a kind at that price )cracked S9!",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Samsung is years ahead of Apple smartphones and is the leading smartphone for technology. I've always been an Apple user, since I switched to Samsung I would never switch back! The camera leaves all other smartphone cameras in the past. Battery lasts all day long and it even come with a stylist!! Boasts the best software and charges wirelessly",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Camera is great in all conditions, however, natural sunlight is the best lighting. The brightness of the display is outstanding. I will comment that I hate how it takes like 10 seconds to change the power saving mode, and the phone lags out hard in these 10 seconds. I use my phone to take pictures, play games, and watch youtube. Almost all apps run smoothly on my phone.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,I love the phone compared to an iPhone I definatly will keep buying samsung in the future it's so easy to use I've got a good uag case. its been dropped a few times but Hasnt broken yet I also have a cignett glass screen protector. They cost $60 and the case was about $50 from memory so its a lot to outlay in 1 go when you include norton ontop but I am glad I upgraded because I cant fault the phone at all. Love the curved glass screen and with double the warranty than an iPhone I just couldnt say no and I'd highly recommend the samsung s9,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"Runs smooth very nice features, does still heat up on under load or on charge, camera is very clear at night.Love the due bluetooth feature.Wish the lcd was higher quality.Does lag when to many apps are open id say after 5 to 6 apps. Battery life is excellent.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"Bought this for my husband as he is an Android user.  Decent size screen, camera takes a really clear shot.  Much better than the Samsung 7 model which he upgraded from.  Got the blue back on it which looks really good. No issues so far... Purchased protective casing also.  Good Phone",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"I am going to start this review off by saying I absolutely love this phone, however it does have a few small compromises (but they're by no means deal breakers).I bought this phone in October after owning iPhones for some time, and am happy with the experience so far. The screen is excellent (as has always been the case with Samsung phones), the app selection rivals what is found on iOS and it has IP68 water resistance which is handy if I get caught in the rain on my commute home from work.I was surprised to discover that the Galaxy S9 has a slightly weaker battery than my iPhone X; however this could be remedied by purchasing the Galaxy S9+ or the Note 9 (which is similar to the S9 with a few extra features) which has a larger battery. I often find myself giving the phone a quick top up before I head out for the evening as the battery doesn't usually make it past 6pm. This is mostly painless though as Samsung includes a fast charger in the box (unlike Apple where you have to buy a fast charger separately).The other small issue I have with this phone is how long Samsung takes to release software updates. For example, the S9 is still running Android 8 Oreo even though Android Pie has been out for some months. This has always been an issue with Samsung and will hopefully be fixed with Project Treble (an attempt by Google to push software updates to more phones quicker). I would've liked to see pure Android on this flagship instead of a skinned version.Like I said at the beginning of this review, the things I have mentioned above are not deal breakers, and would certainly not stop me from recommending this phone to anyone.What I like:The camera- pictures are always sharp and detailed, just like they were on my old iPhone XSoftware (kind of)- Samsung has really cleaned up their Android skin over the past yearUSB C- Everything is beginning to adopt USB C which means carrying around fewer cablesWireless charging- very convenient, especially when it's darkIP68 water resistance- Handy when I get caught in the rain on my commute homePowerful CPU and plenty of RAM- If it wasn't for uni, I could potentially get away with using this as my primary computing deviceSomething else worth mentioning is how Samsung bundled a free pair of JBL noise cancelling headphones, worth nearly $400 with the phone- a worthy extra.Overall, I have no hesitation in recommending this phone to those who want the best of all worlds. However if you're a heavy user (someone who uses their phone for 12+ hours per day), I'd recommend the S9+ or the Note 9 as they both have larger batteries.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"This has been a great phone, the camera is great. Brightness is great, even in bright sun when it's oftentimes difficult to see the screen on other devices. Great memory storage, even for a smaller memory phone, I have hundreds of games, photos, music and apps with still plenty of storage. Never had a problem with apps freezing and glitching. All around great with functions and durability, lightweight and a bonus of coming in a pretty Lilac color!",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,Everything all good. Perfect smart phone I ever have had. Good rare camera. Easy to use. I just love it.  I have been using it from more than 6 month after I lost my iphone and I have not got anything to complain yet. Would really recommend all to use it.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"Everything about this phone is awesome. I've got the plus version. High quality screen with a great screen size. The only problem is the price which I think is a bit high. Otherwise there is no problem with the phone. Fantastic battery life, good speed and very high quality photos.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"People have been amazed at the quality of the camera, wondering if I used a mobile phone or a more serious camera. The slo-mo function is also excellent, allowing for some really fun videos of the kids jumping into the pool, fighting with foam swords etc. The form factor is good - a bit screen but not too big to fit in your hands. The dedicated Bixby button is slightly annoying at first, and I haven't used the Bixby function, but you can turn it off so it's not really an issue. The fingerprint scanner is sensibly located on the back of the phone. Overall it's a great phone.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"Love the displayLove the feelLove the runLove the battery timeI've had a Samsung galaxy for the past 6 years... so not much has changed in the standard.Still trying to work out all the camera features. Everyone tells me it can take a great photo.... probably user error... but my photo's are still looking pretty basic compared to what my friend is taking on her iphone. So I guess I need to google and work out how to use the pro feature? My one wish is that it would just take a super high res, high colour photo without me having to do the work?",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"I have been using the S9 now for a few months.  Overall great experience.  Mobile internet, SMS, and calls - all are seamlessly working.  Even if on the phone for a long call, it does not get too warm.  Battery life is also good. Phone camera is also improved.  It could improve on the quality of the earphones but overall its a great day to day phone to use.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"Love my new Samsung phone! The battery lasts for the whole day. The display is also bright and easy to adjust. I am satisfied with the phone features for the camera. There are selfie option, slow motion and plenty of others.The only downside would be the infinite screen, because sometimes it makes it difficult to put screen saver.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,The camera on this phone is phenomenal. Clear pictures even in low light. Streams movies easily and responds really well. Apps run smoothly on this model and I have had no issues as yet. Love the fingerprint capability on the back of the phone. Don't really like Bixby and it was difficult to get used to the extra button on the left hand side.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Everything runs smoothly, travelling around in a caravan so need the blue tick it has to get more phone signals.  Very quick loading apps, easy to use.  Camera is amazing with lots of options for photos and very easy for me so a grandmother to download photos of new grandsons",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"I've owned Samsung Galaxy phones since the S4. There's a reason why they are the most popular, they are simply the best by performance and features in the smallest package.I'll keep buying these phones if they continue to make them this good.The only thing I don't like and it's the same with all smart phones is that the screens break so easily.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"S9 screen unconventional, double curved screen Yan value, different light colors. The high-pass 845 CPU is very smooth and the program is open to run quickly. 12 million variable aperture dual camera, 1.5 large aperture, night vision illusion the effect is also very good. The shooting worked well. The screen resolution is high, the color is rich, the display effect is good. The battery is enough to charge once a day. The downside is that some apps are temporarily not equipped for Android 8.0, turn on the flash, part of the optimization is not enough, the phone is sometimes hot and hot, such as when charging music. Summary: Samsung S9 looks very nice, well-equipped, very good product.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,1,"Never been more upset with a phone before coming from using an iPhone after 6 years to this. Battery is horrible, phone dials people itself, screen sometimes plays up, way too expensive to fix and Samsung don't help In any way. Have had it for nearly 2 months now and screen decides to freeze and go yellow on its own.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"Originally in the use of the note series, s9+ most attracted me is Bixby, really can use the voice of the assistant, a long and narrow shape, good grip, the photo is very wide, the screen display effect is gorgeous; fingerprint lock more than the old generation of machine sensitivity increased several times, arc screen touch than flat screen more mellow, CPU GPU performance has been very good for me.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"Good performance, the basic battery to rush once a day, not very often play games, only watch news and chat. Standby state power consumption is a bit high, video chat more than 10 minutes the camera will be a bit hot. Playing games is easy, there is no non-smooth phenomenon. Facial iris recognition is sensitive. The camera night view effect is very good. Summary, battery good, other aspects perfect.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"This phone is So nice to look at. Its thin and curved. Fits in the hand well.I love that the phone is waterproof, I have washed it under the tap and have had not issues.The phone has excellent features for security and connections, you can login with face recognition or iris or both. You can also use finger prints.I love this phone.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"This phone has a beautiful quality display. The flash with night photo mode is great. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly when being used, while I'm not using it it keeps the charge well. I always have it playing music to bluetooth headphones at night and approx 70% gets me through the night without having to leave it plugged into a charger.Apps and games run smoothly.The worst part of this phone is the curved screen and not being able to get a screen protector to STAY ON. I've had them put on by mobile phone 'kiosks' etc, tried different types, gel and glass and they all lift eventually and always have at least 1 bubble. I will not own another curved screen phone after this one.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,I hate BIXBY  and do not want to use it ...but it insists upon itself ...what a waste of a butyon grrrrrrr SO ANNOYING also taking screenshots id a pain in the butt ...hard to make work and invokes BIXBY WHICH I HATE.Lost so much functionality with camera to last model ...downgrade not upgrade ...no portrait functionality any more,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,1,"At first glance the s9 is beautiful. Then you turn the thing on and you get to know it more and it starts to do some silly things. I have never had an issue with Apple. It always run everything smooth and you get pretty much everything you backed up. My s9 keyboard started to type things on its own while I was typing so I took it in to the shop and they done a software reboot. I lost 4 months worth of photos of my family and other important files that I will never get back. Changing to Samsung is the worse thing I have ever done. I just recontracted so I can't do much to change my phone. But I will definitely go back to iPhone as soon as my 1 year is up. Samsung phones tries to do to much and everything crap itself. While iPhone is so user friendly, I don't know why people would ever go for Samsung. This idiot did it. Don't make the same mistake.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,"Camera quality is good although i find it hard to be advertised as one of the major selling points of this phone, I would personally not buy this phone based on the Camera quality. Display is good and brightness settings (cant complain). My biggest complaint with this phone being one of the latest is that there is no IR meaning apps like tv remote do not work where as more affordable phones manage to have this feature. Also the phone boasts on being waterproof yet my speakers muffle at the slightest touch of water ...go figure.. this phone is far from living up to expectations.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Suddenly phone-less, I was shown the Galaxy S9 in Telstra shop and initially skeptical that it was similar in performance and features to a long-serving LG phone. I made a list of features, and they all got ticked off before yet more eye-catching features were added to the list...Things got better and better once I had a play with the real deal rather than a locked-up dummy! Extremely speedy, crisp operation, a true delight to hold and operate. As with so many other phones, a little slippery and slender so it requires (demands!) a secure grip, ably assisted by something like an Otterbox. Bought it immediately, no questions asked and haven't questioned the purchase at any time.  Built-in auto-on/off blue light filter for night use saves scouring the Google store for something presumably better. Self-adjusting display visibility makes it a dream to use in bright daylight as well as those pesky late night calls. When on fast-charge, it has a sleepy, dreamy, gradually alternating ""daydream"" colour pattern. Notifications are quite novel: a small tri-coloured LED on the front is assisted by a vibration and peculiar change of the display to a pale yellow -- takes some getting used to initially, but very effective at attracting attention (for better, for worse...). All apps run smoothly with no hang-ups at all.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"I recently upgraded my Samsung galaxy 5 to the Samsung galaxy 9 and there is definitely a noticeable difference in the operating system. The galaxy 9 has much more features, is much more user friendly. Has far superior security measures. Not to mention all the additional features it has to offer.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,I am happy with everything about the phone. Great latest technology with samsung. I have had lots of samsung ones and this is the best! The camera is super clear and captures great moments. I use lots of different apps on this phone. I love how you can see the time lit up even when you're not using the phone.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,I've had Samsung's ever since they first came out. From the s1 to s9. I wouldn't buy anything else. Only thing that puts me off is the expensive screen repairs if the screen cracks. Also the phone charge seems to die quickly even if you leave your phone all night on charge.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Camera is amazing it's a huge step up from my non exploding Note Edge. Good size, stable software, no complaints. Battery is average but will last 2 days if not used heavily. Wireless charging works well but note that it takes twice as long as plugging it in. yes it has a headphone jack, which is great.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"The Samsung Galaxy S9 is my fifth Galaxy after my S2, S4, S6 and S7.  It is simply the best solution for me.  As a camera it excels.  The S7 was nearly there but the front camera wasn’t quite what I wanted.  The S9 now does it all.  Perfect in low light, fabulous portraiture, sharper output than any camera lens I own and versatile for 95% of photography.  I use it for all product shots on eBay and it has made my life a lot easier.  As a portable computer it organizes my 7,000 database records with ease in the Contacts folder.  Battery life is excellent and wireless charging is spot on.  The audio input jack is a continuing bonus and this makes for a versatile audio recorder in all situations.  USB C connection is great.  Speakers are terrific, the screen is great for video playback.  The S9 is a powerhouse with intuitive, useful software that is quick to use in any situation.  Build quality and waterproofing are first rate.  The size is perfect for me which is why I chose it over the S9+.  It can nearly replace any other camera I use professionally but it can’t handle ultra wide interior photography.  It is missing the 3:2 format which is what I prefer, so I hang onto other cameras for this purpose.  But given that it is always on me, means there is the matter of convenience and confidence knowing that I can make do at a pinch.  Multi tasking means making a phone call, sending a text and dealing with email all at the same time.  Android software means it is an open system that is constantly being developed so I don’t feel I am being held hostage to proprietary software.  From a productivity point of view, it is a compliment to a powerful laptop and camera systems that lets me develop my imagination, express my creativity and do everything I want that was still impossible, as recently as two years ago.  There are cheaper alternatives starting to come out of China that are similar but for the time being I am sticking with Samsung Galaxy, as they have never let me down.  This factor alone never makes me wonder about the top price proposition that is being paid.  What is the point of saving money if what you buy can’t do what you want?  With an S9 I don’t have to wonder.  If I didn’t have it I would use my S7 because that was nearly as good.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"The camera is powerful at any time! Camera feature is the most prominent in this phone.I love the design and the display is just amazing.I got all apps can run smoothly so far.The price is quite expensive, so I think bundling price is much preferred for buying this phone.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,I purchased my phone through our local Telstra shop. One of the features I was looking for in my new phone was a good quality camera. I have been more than impressed with the camera even more than I expected. The bigger screen shows quality images that I am more than happy with. In fact on a recent week long island holiday I used camera phone exclusively rather than my stand alone camera. I am more than happy with the brightness of the display. I also do use my phone to check E mails as well as a camera.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"In love with my new phone! I think its excellent that it comes with a back protective case to save the beautiful colour from being damaged by every day use. Love the ""edge"" it's a very snazzy look. The only negative so far is it only plays the first 30 seconds of each of the songs in my playlist,  however I suspect this can be easily resolved in settings somewhere, I just haven't worked it out yet. Thanks Samsung, you've delivered yet again!",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,"Omg I hate hate hate Bixbie, granted I don't know what it is or how it works except and a marketing device that gets in the way everytime I use the phone. I do not want advertising on my phone!!!!! I have managed to turn everything Bixbie off but it is so horrible I can't like my phone, it has tainted any enjoyment I could of had from having a new phone. I was an iPhone user and the similar but different operating system is annoying to get used to, the change in connecting cables from previous Samsungs is annoying too, Siri was not something I used but at least I could choose his voice for when I did use him and he didn't try to sell me anything. I get Bixbie is Samsung's Siri but it is a horrible version.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,"OK,  so it's a good phone.  But the battery sucks so bad I LITERALLY returned the brand new S9! I'm so surprised to. With all the updates and software on the device that to expect the battery to just run out so quickly and easily. It's a nightmare! I need a phone,  all day everyday and I'm used to using a phone all day everyday without recharging, not with the S9!",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Fantastic phone charges super fast ,battery last ages , take beautiful photos with lots of option ,slow motion is awsome.  Screen is vibrant and really clear if you like taking photos or videos this is the phone for you. The phone features are great and it has some really good widgets.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,Photo quality is absolutely amazingEasy to useBattery life is greatLoved my 7 but this just has that extra you wanted not neededStruggling with do I keep and jump up the new note?Either way loving my new phone the only negative I have was can you make sure a few phone covers are brought out when you release straight away as I wanted to protect phone straight away lol,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Great quality. Wished that the battery last longer.Small, thin, compact. Comes with a clear phone cover.Easy to transfer iPhone data to Samsung S9.Purchased the samsung gear S3 frontier.My husband talked me into changing to Samsung. Pretty happy.There is an option to add SD card for extra storage, which you can purchase from JB Hi Fi.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"Camera quality on S9 is just amzaing. I've been using it for the last six months now and happy with the overall performance too. A slightly disappointing thing is the battery life. Compare to other high end phones available in the market, I think S9 is far behind in this",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"This samsung Galaxy S9 has all the right stuff and is built very well,the camera works well in all kinds of light and the video runs at a slow motion speed if you want it to Great to have,it even comes with a cable so you can lift all your files off your old phone,this made life for me a lot easier and saved me a lot of time.I recommend this great phone to anyone thinking about buying one.I also bought the cordless charger dock station and that is also great,no need for cables anymore.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Recently upgraded from a Note 4 to the S9. I run my business almost entirely from my phone and had been very happy with the Note 4 until it began to have major hardware issues that could not be rectified. I was initially a little concerned about the shift down in screen size, as I had become so accustomed to the larger Note 4 screen, however the infinity display on the S9 has more than made up for this with almost the entire screen utilised. The phone is super fast and switches between apps seamlessly, as well as being capable of running many apps at once without slowing down. The sound quality is superb, I can play music directly from my phone and it is clear and harmonic. I have been equally impressed by the quality of the both the front facing and rear cameras, especially in low light conditions. My only dislike with the S9 is that the screen picks up fingerprints easily and I find I need to polish them away regularly or else the screen looks dirty. But this is only a minor cosmetic issue and doesn't affect the overall performance of the phone.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,This is the nicest coloured mobile I've ever had. The display is an excellent size & picture quality. Bought a toughened glass screen cover so hopefully it will be extremely durable. I use my mobile to play lots of games so the 64GB is going to be fantastic. Everything seems to run as smoothly as all my past Samsung's although as it's brand new I'm still exploring it's many features.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,I loved my s8 then decided to upgrade to s9. Big regrets!! My smses to friends are delayed or end up grouped and recieved hours later! Very unreliable SMS service! The rest of the phone is great. Just not the SMS. I really regret the mobile now! I dont recommend it! My friend has same phone and he has same problems!,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,"Had phone for a total of 3 hours  and hate it .Any functions close to edge of screen you need to nearly press your finger through the glass to get to respond .Face , retina and fingerprint login have repeatedly failed so switched them off .Smart switch transfer only transferred some of my apps and corrupted some that did make it across  .Bluetooth recognition to car won't work .",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"This phone is reasonably easy to find my way around the settings. Similar to my old phone, which helped, but a couple of features l had to enlist my adult children to  help. The camera is absolutely terrific on the phone - so clear and so is the video footage. Google maps have had a big work out since moving to the city - and the messenger app is already in the phone - handy.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,1,"My laptop stays connected, my tablet does but this phone cant stay connected reliably for despite being the so called best android phone of 2018. Never going to buy another samsung product again. I guess the specs are good, it looks good but if a phone cant do something as basic as this properly then its a horrible product. There are phones as good as this out there which cost less but aren't recognized as much because Samsung has been feeding off its own overrated brand name.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"The Galaxy S9 is the perfect-sized phone. It’s easy to wrap our palms around this smooth 5.8-inch device, and our fingers ergonomically rest on the curved edges along the S9’s frame. The power button on the right edge sits in an easy-to-access position, as does the Bixby button on the left edge. It’s a shame we’ve turned off Bixby’s functionality, so the button remains useless — more on that later.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,I don't like that you can't customize much at all on this phone. The ring tones and message notification sounds aren't that good. Background and themes are so limited. Can't change message background. Can't change keyboard. I shouldn't have to download apps to customize my phone to how I want it.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,Got this as a present from my husband so I can take lots of photos and videos of our newborn. Love the camera and storage capacity. There's so many new features that I haven't yet explore but overall I am pretty happy with the functionality and battery life of the S9. It's such a pretty colour too. If someone can give me tips on how to fully utilise the phone that will be even more awesome,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,"The phone is as good as the price tag suggests.. but Bixby.. with a hardware button? What is this rubbish. I hope Samsung's bloatware goes in the other direction next model (or the next model I buy).I grabbed a Gear VR for this phone (get the newer one that runs on with Note 8). Fantastic, not any really deep VR games, but it's pretty fun for a $150au add on.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,1,So frustrating. Try sending a message to a new number. Nightmare!! No write new message button. Loved my Note 4.... loath the changes on S9. Keyboard changes mean dialogue box keeps jumping because arrow buttons too close to dialogue box edges... big time buyers regret.Battery life not soo great either.. disappointed,Productreview.com.au

galaxy,5,"Fantastic phone. Awesome screen, camera and sound - with quick charge and very good software.The only Con would be having to navigate through all the Google software which literally tries to overtake your life. Not happy Google.This is my 4th Samsung phone and by far the best. Very expensive new, so I got mine pre-loved for around half price with brand new accessories.It does attract fingerprints, but it's worth it for a great looking machine.Very good job Samsung.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,Had for just over a month now and loving it. It's a step up from what I had previously but still a Samsung. Everything makes sense and much easier to use. Love the camera and wider screen from the S6. The picture is much clearer and loved how easy it was to transfer my apps across from my old phone.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,The new features on this phone are a great addition and worthy of the money. The edge of phone with short cuts great. Big storage is perfect with option of extending further. The new camera takes amazing. The new surcety fixtures options are more than perfect overall a perfect phone.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,1,This phone is confusing and badly designed always had Samsung phones this will be my last. Texting is a nightmare with its curved screen.cant figure out how to differ my ringtones. If your looking for a new phone give this one a miss.phew thanks Samsung for all the activation you have caused me.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,I switched from iPhone to Samsung and I would definitely not look back. I am very happy with my choice and I have the feeling I did a good saving. Love the shape the features and price was not bad in comparation with the similar iPhone 8. I might never get an iphone again if this is going to be so good as it's right now.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,I reluctantly upgraded from the s7 but I am pleasantly surprised with some of the new features on this model. I love the Bixby addition and no longer have to search through my phone looking for apps or programs. The sound and picture quality when playing movies is seamless and fantastic quality. My only issue was when I used smartswitch to transfer from my old to my new phone was that it didn't migrate passwords and spent a lot of time resetting passwords for apps and functions. All my net passwords were backed up my Google.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,"If this phone came without Bixby I'd give this item 4 stars. Or at least come without the need for 3rd party app to disable.Very poor button sizing, needs to be addressed.Great earphones.Getting annoyed at this fifty words requirement. When only a few can describe accurately and just as easily",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,This was a replacement upgrade phone for my partner.  An upgrade from an s5 that really highlights the changing technology in only 4 years period. A sleek and super fast machine. An outstanding camera and battery life. This is  one of the best phones I've seen. This really is a pleasure to use and with smaller screen than the s9+ it makes it easier to handle.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,Samsung have always brought out great phones but this one definitely tops them all. The camera on this model is fantastic!! The battery life is great. All the extra features and apps that they offer make my busy everyday life so much easier. I would recommend this phone to anyone!,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Samsung never ceases to amaze me with their smartphones. I have owned a Samsung Galaxy since the S4 and have upgraded to every iteration ever since. The latest S9 has exceeded all expectations and is a minor improvement over its predecessor S8. The crystal clear display and the camera are the 2 main reasons to get this phone as they beat all other phones that are currently in the market. Although the battery life for this phone can be improved, it still manages to last a whole day before the next charge.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"The camera is fantastic and I'm yet to use it to it's full potential. It's very quick, hasn't frozen on me yet.It's super easy to synch with your previous phone.The battery life could be better, I charge it most nights but that's not an issue for me.I wish it had a home button on the side rather than just an on/off button.  I turned off Bixby as it annoyed me, so now I have a button on the side that does nothing. Still better than having bixby on the whole time.I'd still get this phone again.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"The layout can look busy, there are so many apps. Also, I always accidently press this button that takes you to an app, which is annoying. Not sure why theres a button for it. Other than that,  I love the camera and its features. Theres also a lot of security features you can use e.g. facial recognition.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,"Bought this recently, great camera on it, but the battery life is TERRIBLE. Samsung really stuffed this up and seems like the Exynos chip is to blame that we are stuck with in Australia. If I had the choice again would probably wait a few months and get the next gen and hold onto old phone.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"The S9 fulfills my expectations for the latest model from Samsung Galaxy. The design is sleek and I find it to be particularly visually appealing and ergonomic. As usual, the specifications for Samsung are fairly market  leading; the screen resolution is high, the camera is sharp etc.. The messaging functions are however slightly more challenging as I find it little bit harder to work out how to schedule messages in comparison to the previous model I owned.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,"1.) Visual aid CONSTANTLY turning on = needs a new access mode. Can't even tell you how many times I have had to go into Accessabillty to turn it off. Super annoying.2.) Bixby does NOT need a side button. Home screen icon, great. But a side button makes it (again) annoying to have to constantly swipe away.3.) And MOST IMPORTANTLY, I was told this phone was fast as heck, the best phone on the market by far. First few days, good but nothing special. Less than 2 weeks on...pitiful. I have pretty average apps on my phone. No games, etc. Clean privacy settings, etc. It is now slower than my S6. It seems like it just went kaput.      Going back to the store tomorrow.VERY DISAPPOINTED",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,The camera takes crappy pictures and when you close your phone it opens apps by itself. Bigsby is annoying and a waste of time. He/she is not very smart. I would of kept my Galaxy 7 if I knew ahead of time that this phone is garbage. Next time I'm doing my research first.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,Bought this phone about a month ago from Optus. They had the right colour (black) and is more stylish than apple products. Everyone loves the edge. Perfect size. Works very very fast. Looks beautiful. The camera is very nice One of the best smartphone out there. I recommend this phone.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,This is the first Samsung I have owned. I have used nothing but Nokia/Microsoft.I found it pretty easy to navigate and it is generally user friendly.I paid the extra money and bought the LED cover ($89.95). Not completely happy with it (its harder to hold and you cant really fold the cover completely backwards) but it is hand being able to see the time and who is calling on the LED strip (plus you can personalise their number with a picture or their name).,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,I don't know if I  have a  lemon but this phone is tap tap tap tap before it will go anywhere. For example it has taken nearly 15 minutes to write this ! I constantly have to check or go back to see if the function I'm  trying is occurring. I'm  extremely unhappy with spending 700.00 plus for this poor of quality  that will likely  only last 3 years at best. Money talks and that shows when Samsung and Apple control the market.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"This is my first Samsung/Android phone. I've been living a sheltered life trying to make do with the windows OS on previous Nokia phones which I really thought were great phones, just severely let down by Windows. So, the S9; when I first got it, it was so easy to figure out the settings to personlise to my desire. The apps and games work flawlessly so it has a strong functuonality. I have had a few freezes, but it's easily reset and works fine after a restart. The design is nice and the wireless charging is a great feature. I'll leave the nit picking of design concept and hardware to the professionals, but to the layman like me, it is great to pick up and fire away with my favorite games and apps.",Productreview.com.au

galaxy,2,"I've switched over from iphone to the Samsung Galaxy S9 and have buyers remorse! Why on earth would they build in a designated button for Bixby? The button is always accidentally touched and activates Bixby!Connectivity - despite playing around with the battery life, adjusting other settings and following all online advice, the phone seems to have trouble opening videos and certain photos, such as Instagram video reels and real estate.com photos. It will however open videos and photos at random times?? It's almost like it cannot receive that amount of data at one time. I've tried different types of WIFI and 4g/3g connections. If you're big on social media, this is a major problem and extremely annoying. The connectivity  also seems to be a problem when trying to cast from apps such as Netflix, Hayu and ABC etc., the cast symbol on the phone is dulled out meaning that it cannot pick up or sense a device to cast to. When this happens, I go straight to my 'old' iphone 6 and cast to my device. No problems.I originally switch over for the camera, which is great but with all the other issues, which are quite basic really, it hardly seems worth putting up with. I will be selling it, if I can that is and will switch back to iphone.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,"I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S9 about 2 weeks ago after being a satisfied S5 user for several years.  I instantly disliked the 'BIXBY"" feature which is so easily turned on with the switch on the left hand side. Also the background noise is so annoying!! It took some attempts through Samsung to get it deleted/removed.Since a software update yesterday it seems I can't dial local numbers without putting in the area code, including those in my Contacts. The Samsung 1300 help desk and their Chadstone store can't solve the issue and it seems it is not a problem encountered elsewhere. All settings were thoroughly checked. The Chadstone store put my SIM card in one of their phones and there was no problems. They suggested a 'reflash' of the software but I may lose data which I first need to backup.I also went to my local Telstra store and they have not encountered this issue before.So far I am not impressed with this phone, I don't see how it can be labelled a 'smart' phone.",Productreview.com.au

galaxy,1,"I recently changed from apple to samsung but I was shocked to get pop up adverts on my samsung. So this experament is over, I never had pop ups in my iPhone. The samsung is faster but at least I don't get pop up adverts while using my iPhone. Don't buy.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Upgrading from a S7, I've fallen in love with my S9, I love using it, the screen is glorious, the camera is great, it's fast and slick and with Android you can customise a lot!But on the flip side the battery life is very very challenging, I'm always charging it throughout the day. I'm getting used to the finger print reader but unlocking the phone when it's mounted in the car is challenging. Video recording is limited to 5-10 minutes in 4k unlike iPhones that record unlimited.Overall, if I had to recommend a phone in 2018, I'd go for the iPhone 8 as it has an ace battery, ace performance, ace camera, touch ID and with Apple Care you're protected in case of damage.But, I'm still very happy with my S9, as I'm an Android guy and this is the best Android phone you can get, even with all the compromises.Full In-Depth Video Review: https://youtu.be/jsmYYXq6NpA",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,"Just got my new s9 was pretty excited because of all the hype surrounding it but was a bit dissapointed some features.The first being that you cant customize your ph contacts with anything. No personalized ringtone, msg tone, or even pic of your contact. Bummer.Also the super slow mo feature is really annoying in that you can only use it in short bursts when recording so your video jumps from normal speed to super slow mo & back again.If you crack the screen your looking at $500 to if get it fixed.If these things dont bother you then it's a great phone but for me, the lack of customization was a deal breaker.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,"This phone does have some practical issues. With a protective screen cover the touch screen on the smooth edge is difficult to use. The other problem is lack of the home, return and screen buttons on the bottom which i had on the s6 makes it difficult for navigation. Every thing else is great but these issues lowered my over all opinion.",Productreview.com.au

iphone,1,"There are 2 types of iPhone X uses.  Those who have dropped their phone (and lightened their wallet) and those that soon will.It took Apple years to get up to speed with larger screens on the iPhone and when they did, they literally made them as fragile as glass.  Everybody drops their phone sometime and making it with materials this breakable is ridiculous.  When you drop it, it will break and the cost of a new screen is A$450+I now use mine as a home handset, I rarely will carry it with me.  Too expensive an item to risk damage which defeats its purpose almost entirely.You can buy a robust case, and you should, but that will destroy the aesthetic if that was part of the reason you bought one and still doesn't guarantee it won't break when you drop it.  Also beware of folio style cases which hold the phone with magnets, with a small bump, they will let go when you least expect it.I'll keep mine until 5G rolls out and then buy a large screen phone from a competitor.

iphone,5,"This is the best iPhone since my iPhone 6 plus. I had iPhone 3, 4, 5, 6 plus and 7 plus and this is the big step that I was waiting finally a device with a big screen that can fit in my pocket and use with one hand.Just for the Oled screen is worth to buy and if you compare to an LCD like the Xr there will be always a big gap and the screen is the most important feature in a mobile now.Yes it is expensive but it is worth the money as finally it feels like a phone ready for the future and face id works perfectly after a week with face id you would not like to go back to touch id and I was previously thinking touch id is the best.Best part I just also got a new battery replacement for free so my iPhone might last perfectly till 2020 for the iPhone 5g but iPhone xi will bring an important feature: USB C type",Productreview.com.au

My son dropped his i phone X in a spa for approx 2 secs and its damaged. Took it to apple and they point blank refuse to fix under warranty, saying its liquid damage and its not covered under warranty.BEWARE if you buy an i phone !!!  They are NOT splash or water proof at all ( They say up to 2mtrs for up to 30 min ! Load of bull ) The apple representative said there is no warranty on any iphone for any liquid damage no matter what, it has an IP rating of IP 68. Who knows what that means unless you are an apple employee.I have had over 10 i phones and now that i need a repair for water damage they knock you back instantly because its "" liquid damage "".I asked him if it was damaged by rain falling on it would he cover the warranty and he said NO, because its 68 IP rating.The phone is amazing BUT its NOT water proof nor resistant as they state.ITS FALSE ADVERTISING end of story.This should not be allowed as its misleading to consumers",Productreview.com.au

iphone,4,The phone could break easy as it is glass front and back so you will need a screen protector or case.

iphone,3,The camera is better. Scream is sharp but they took off the night time yellow screen from the drop down menu. It's too heavy. Wish there is a smaller version and more colours choices. Black and white is not very interesting.  The screen is too big and wide for female and a bit over priced.,Productreview.com.au

iphone,3,The iPhone X is a great working phone the battery life on it is amazing and the camera quality is quite impressive as well. However I find having no home button quite annoying at times. You can’t just quickly tap on the home button when in an app you have to drag the bottom section of the screen up to the top of the screen. I also find turning the phone off quite difficult as well as you have to hold down two separate buttons. Other than that it’s a great phone.,Productreview.com.au

iphone,5,iPhone X is the perfect size and has an incredible camera. Camera allows for better quality than before and has a portrait mode for both cameras (front facing and back).At night it features a setting which allows flash in front facing camera to help for clear pictures. Normal camera flash has also helped create clear pictures than before.Social media.Very smoothly. Haven’t had any glitches. Only time it runs slow is right before it’s about to die at 1%,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Love it, pretty easy to use but just too expensive. Was using Android before and now switching it to iPhone simply because it is easier to navigate through the phone and everything is simply and straight forward. The only let down is probably that I can’t upgrade my storage like I did with Samsung",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"It unlocks pretty fast using the Face ID, charges pretty quickly and the camera quality is to die for! My youngest son who is 10 got this when it first came out and loves it.

It's such a great iPhone, we love it!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I have had every iPhone since the 3G. I had the iPhone 8+ previously to this (there were not that many upgrades between the 6+ and the 8+ as it was). Honestly, the software didn’t do much. Sure, you got Animojis but you rarely use them. The camera wasn’t noticeably different in quality.Face ID is fine, no complaints. But when it comes to running - apps close, the phone freezes (will go black with no reason and might respond a couple of minutes later after pressing the side button quite a few times).Having no home button can be a pain, especially for hard resets or trying to see the bottom of the screen.Here’s to hoping Apple actually really upgrades next years model (not this years XS & XS Max) - there’s been very little improvements over the last few years and it’s disappointing.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Very satisfied with my purchase of the iPhone X. I was previously using the 7 and was scared to switch to the X due to its advertised size. I only realised later that the screen size of the iPhone X compared to the 7 isn't that much different due to the new OLED display which takes up most of the screen space. Very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend buying the iPhone X now. Was thinking of buying the iPhone XS but as the price was still high decided against it and got a pre-owned iPhone X instead which saved me about $700.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Durability and brighntess of phone is great, apps run smoothly and camera is terrific! Getting used to not having the home button is fine.

iphone,4,"Camera: Let me start this off by saying I am a 20-something individual so camera quality is everything to me. I love the iPhone X cameras (front and back). Great for taking pictures in all lighting and great pre-editing features to make your pics pop. You'll probably like the camera.Durability: I have dropped my phone on any surface imaginable and I still have not cracked it. For me, that's a definite win because I am notoriously clumsy. I have also dropped my phone in the bath, pool and shower. Still perfect (bonus if you have a case)General Use: It calls and texts. The screen brightness is great. There are also a lot of random features that you never think you will need until you need them. I work a lot on my computer and I love that I could also actually work from my phone. The full screen is great for watching videos too - the notch is a bit annoying though. The Face ID is great and gets better as you continue to use it. It now recognizes my face (and not the face of others) in nightclubs, when I have my sunglasses and  glasses on, and even when I am in bed. It took about a month for my phone to recognize my face in all these ""environments""OS and Apps: Apps and OS are standard. I have had a bit of trouble using the Beta iOS's though but these issues are usually fixed pretty quickly.BATTERY LIFE: This is where the iPhone X is a bit of a bummer. Admitedly, I use my phone a lot but I find that my battery health has deteriorated pretty quickly with this phone. My battery runs out pretty quickly when listening to music. I probably get about 3/4 of a day before I need to recharge again for the night. The wireless charging is great though, especially when I am at work. I can charge my phone wirelessly and listen to music using the port =.Basically: it's an iPhone.",Productreview.com.au

iphone,4,"I purchased the international model from Kogan,It was a good phone, everything worked well, however I decided to sell it and downgrade due to the fact that it was quite expensive, I wanted to get rid of it before the value fell due to the release of the newer models.

Otherwise there are cheaper options that give you similar features.",Productreview.com.au

Phones with good reception have a blue tick given by Telstra or classed as good for regional from Optus both to date have not given anything on the reception.People after a the iPhone for us in the rural or country areas should not even bother with the new model iPhone X models as they will have very poor reception even for people in the city. (Telstra gives a ""Blue Tick"" for phones that have good reception).The duel sim could have helped people in rural  or pleaces with limited reception from one carrier but using 2 sims might have helped using 2 different carriers.Duel sim could have even helped people who traveled a lot over sea's as well so they could turn off there data to sim and put another sim so they could use the data from the area the country they where traveling in.We are the user the customer and we should be able to have control over the items we want and wish to buy.But the Telcos controle these things based on profits.So from me to anyone wanting to buy any iPhone please find out the Battery life or what reception it has if its poor do not buy it.",Productreview.com.au

iphone,4,"The iPhone X has adopted the most varied design language in recent years, keeping up with the full-screen trend and raising the upper limit of the overall screen design of the entire industry. If you ignore the left, right and bottom borders, iPhone X's screen ratio can easily kill all kinds of Android full screen emperor. However, due to the screen display technology, these extra frames are a last resort.In addition to being ugly by people, the iPhone X's Qi Liuhai is very unfriendly to the application. Basically, the application for adaptation is also chosen to avoid Qi Liu, instead of using the space around the bangs. In addition to the bangs, the seemingly beautiful rounded corner design is also a headache for developers.",Productreview.com.au

It’s very expensive though and possibly not worth the price, however if it’s your primary device then you might be able to justify the purchase.

iphone,4,"I do love this phone. It’s easy and quick to type as my last s6 phone is terrible for the keyboard. Siri isn’t as good as I was hoping it would be. She cannot make calls or write notes or take screenshots like google assistant could. It’s bright and the camera takes stunning images. In landscape mode, the shots are a lot narrower than the Samsung’s though which is a little annoying. Still has a much better picture. It feels nice and weighty in my hand. Solid and sturdy. The screen is bright. I enjoy the navigation by swiping up and around though I am still yet to discover how to turn it on and off, I could google it but have just been lazy. The one thing I truly despise on the iPhone though is the Apple App Store. Even if you type the exact name of an app it’ll show what it thinks is more popular first, nesrly every app you need to pay for and if it’s free it isn’t really as it has in app purchases. You’re unable to save any apps in a Wishlist type thing like you can on android either. I think android wins in the app department but Apple definitely wins with the camera and navigating around the phone. The iPhone X has widgets but they’re all confined to the far left screen and are basically useless. I like on my s6 being able to customise my screen with apps, folders and widgets. The x is simple but I would prefer it to have this feature. It’s a good phone. Not as great as I was hoping but good.",Productreview.com.au

iphone,5,"I thought I'd splurge and get the iPhone X as I have other Apple products- a 2017 MacBook Pro and iPad Pro 10.5"" to be precise. You can either purchase the device outright (roughly $1600 for the 64GB model), or go on a contract (the latter obviously spreads the cost over 24 months (or 36 with Vodafone)). I love how Apple removed the home button as it was annoying to reach down to go home/authenticate purchases on my old iPhone SE. Face ID, contrary to what some people say, is so easy and seamless. One glance, and the iPhone X unlocks/authenticates payments via Apple Pay. The ability to charge the phone wirelessly is a nice advantage, too. Can't tell you how many times I've tried to plug my phone in at night, only to miss the charging port completely because it's been dark. With wireless charging, it's as easy as placing the iPhone X down on the wireless charging mat (which is obviously purchased separately). If you do decide to take the plunge and purchase the iPhone X, insurance is a must as it's all-glass design feels very delicate. I'd also strongly recommend getting a good case too (Tech21 make great cases in case you're wondering).What I like:Wireless chargingWater resistanceGesture-based UIFace IDWhat I dislike:Nothing at this stageIf you want all the latest and greatest features and can afford to splurge, I'd totally recommend the iPhone X. Otherwise, it may be worth checking out the iPhone 8 if you want a great, reliable iPhone and don't have $1600 (or can't afford to spend $100+ a month).",Productreview.com.au
iphone,1,"I feel I need to warn other users of the flagship Apple iPhone X of something that happened to me while on holidays this May.I took out my $1800+ iPhone X in the rain to take 4-5 images. Supposedly the phone is water resistant at 1m depth for 30 minutes (IP67)...... Well I need to warn everyone that it is NOT resistant to 60 seconds in some rain. I now have an expensive paperweight which Apple will not replace or fix without the payment of $800+.Apple have inspected the phone and have verified that there is water inside it. I cannot dispute that this is the case, but it is the circumstances of the water getting in that is the frustration for me.Taking a water resistant phone out to take 5 images should not result in the phone becoming inoperable.This is a major disappointment after paying a premium for an expensive piece of hardware. I have had more than 16 apple devices linked to my apple id and have never returned or made a claim against an apple product and I have owned many since 1984.I also feel that to advertise the phone as water resistant is misleading if the IP67 rating is 1m deep water for 30 minutes how could I ever have ruined the phone by my hand as it was only damp/wet for a short period and then returned to my dry pocket.Anyway a shout-out to Australia Post Insurance for covering the repairs / replacement of the iPhone which has now been sold and replaced with the Huawei P20 Pro.I will never buy an overpriced apple product again with claims of being able to perform beyond its capabilities.

My thumb automatically goes to switch it on however the facial recognition unlocks the phone straight away and you just have to swipe up to unlock (no thumbprint required!) the facial recognition works really well at night time/dark lighting too I’ve noticed, which is pretty neat. Only downside for me is you have to chose between 64 gigs or 256 - and on my iPhone 7 I’ve used about 3/4 of my 128 gigs.

iphone,5,I have had my iphoen x for a few months and it is amazing everything about it is awesome the water proof feather is amazing and means I can take it scuba diving and take videos Evan with out a case on the only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have a head phone jack bit I use Bluetooth head phones and have no problem,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Ive always had Iphones since they first came out so I know how to use them.  This was the main reason I stayed with Apple rather than buying a Samsung.  Then I had to choose which Apple iPhone to buy.  The reason I chose the iPhone X was because the screen is bigger than the previous models ... it pretty much takes up the whole of the front of the phone which means that its better when I watch youtube or netflix on it, its better when I take photos or videos... its just better for pretty much everything you do on the phone.  In my opinion the phone has a better operating system than any of the previous models....for example google maps seems to work on it really well... also it seems more efficient to do tasks and does them faster than the previous models I have owned.  I could have got an Oppo for a lot less... but I've gone with a cheaper model before and then had to live with it for a couple of years so I don't do that anymore.  Im very happy with the iPhone X.  Without a doubt it is the best phone I've owned and id recommend it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,It is a very good phone. You can quickly get used to it’s touch screen. Face recognition makes everything easier you don’t have to type or use finger print. Rest is typical iPhone features. it looks a bit delicate so it is a good idea to buy sturdy phone cover and screen protector.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"I have had my iphone X for approximately 8 months.  I am happy enough with it but it didn't blow me away compared to the iphone 7 I had previous to this model.  The face-ID can be annoying as it takes awhile to unlock, especially when I'm at work at my desk and don't want to have to keep holding my phone up to unlock it.  At the end of the day it does the job, yet costs a lot.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Apple does it again, you can tell me till the cows come home how great the androids are but they all miss the point where Apple just excels, Apple products just work and make everything so intuitive, so much so that a small child can use without any help. I cannot tell you how great this phone is, just love it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I bought the Iphone X out right for its amazing camera and special features. It achieved beyond my greatest expectations, i wanted a good camera to take to europe with me, then thought i could have an all in one good camera and phone together!

iphone,5,"Apple launched the phone back in November and I was in need of an upgrade from my iPhone 6+ to iPhone X. It is my current phone for day to day use. The battery can easily last for the whole day and I have never been more satisfied with the quality of the customer service and the phone build quality. They are superb!The camera of course has improved, which is good to see. I was able to take better pictures. And the selfie camera is also a huge bonus! I was able to take better quality selfies when being outdoors.Only downside is the price of the phone and how easily prone to screen cracking it is.Otherwise, if you have the money and you have an older iPhone, this phone is definitely for you!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,1,"Purchased X Apple phone. After three months the phone kept frezzing, battler went flat after 4 hours and calls cutting out. Returned to Apple Doncaster with my receipt.

iphone,3,It’s good and nice to use but sometimes when it freezes u just can’t press anything and that’s makes it a bit annoying but i like it and i got used l to it.

iphone,4,"The hardware is awesome it really is but it is let down by the buggy software, come on Apple pick up your game!! Fingers crossed for ios12.They released an oled panel without any kind of dark mode which is just silly, they are clearly going to use it as a selling point come next model,Face ID works well enough that I will say I see why Apple believes it’s the future, If it had a slightly wider fov and was a bit snappier it would feel so natural you would forget it exists. I already do most of the time.Forget about the notch, this phone has absolutely no chin and no top bezel just this notch, the edges are well thought out because any thinner you would have trouble with accidentally touching the sides of the screen.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Bought this phone from Vodafone. It is the best phone ever. Pictures are absolutely stunning and beautiful. Good look and stylish phone. Charge really fast. Very light and good size phone. The service we received from Vodafone online service is absolutely good and I want to thank for their fast delivery service. Love the phone.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,2,Bought an iphone X for my girl friend December last year. I think it's not worth of the price official claimed. Most fancy designs are not friendly to use for example Face ID can't really recogonize you well if you are in the dark environment. Ugly wireless headphone (AirPod). So called 'OLED' glass end up heavier and more fragile than previous ones.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Love my iPhone X! It’s such a beautiful phone so simple and easy to use.So easy to use and an amazing camera as well.If you want something easy and classy the iPhone X is the perfect phone for you!Only downside is the battery life doesn’t last that long and after a month of having my phone my battery health is now on 99%,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Near the end of financial year purchasing, in David Jones, gave a welcome disscount,  some kind of 120 dollar minimise than the retail shop of Apple.

Took it back to Apple and they said that it’s not their problem that “their” software is not working properly.So the conclusion is, I bought the top of the range iPhone and paid so much for it just to have it being the worst performing phone I have ever come across. Also so many people are having problems with it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I purchased this phone a couple of months ago and have been using it everyday since, I think it’s a very good sized phone and model looks good.

iphone,5,"My wife uses this phone, and like my SE iPhone, she loves it like I do. Because of the Touch ID and all being very handy, is the one reason for it to be popular.

iphone,5,"This is the perfect phone, had so many features and the Face ID is the best because it give that extra security and it’s easy to use, I also find the glass is a lot stronger than usual, I’ve dropped my phone multiple times and it still hasn’t broken. Very happy.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"This phone is very average; it is actually a complete disappointment as compared to previous iPhone models -- though the screen size is bigger than any other iPhone model, the reduced size of the physical phone it self makes it difficult to adjust to using it over the previous ""plus"" models.  It has a fast processor and the wireless charging as well as the water resistance of the device are great features, but I feel that it is extremely overpriced as compared to older models.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Moving from an iphone 7 to the X, I was sceptical about the screen size and it it really made a difference... wow, was I shocked. The phone itself is not much bigger and certainly smaller than the plus, but the screen is so much bigger. Now when I go back to a standard 7, the screen is so small in comparison. Highly recommended.",Productreview.com.au

iphone,5,"Absolutely amazing phone even though it is slightly overpriced it is still an absolutely classy phone which makes it stand out of the crowd.

iphone,5,"Great phone but the only issue i have is the screen.. it doesn't work like the iphone 8, the other thing that's really hard to get used to is the fact there is no home button, not sure if i regret this or not. Speed wise and battery life A+++++.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,2,one month into its ownership and the glass on the screen is broken by just a fall from table to floor. Did not know it was so brittle whilst apple lauded about it being durable.

iphone,2,"I am extremely disappointed with the iphone X, being an Apple Fan since iphone 3. It is not user friendly, esp. the photo take of your screen, the shut off button, the torchlight, etc etc. If I have not invested $1000+ for this phone, I would have gotten rid of it! The iphone 6 Plus was a much better innovation by far.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,Love this phone but its definitely overpriced. I've had it since the first week and love the screen. The UI is nice. I dislike their advertising of IP rating water resistant and do not trust it at all. I have already had one phone break on me due to rain.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Love it! Took a little while to get used to the features but once it’s become second nature I have loved it!

iphone,1,I would definately not recommend this phone. Only dropped it once ( on carpet) and the screen cracked immediately . Screen is now possessed and typing random letter. I Only dropped it once and now it’s playing up. It will now cost me 600 to fix the screen. I had an IPhone 6 before and would drop it but never broke the screen.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,This is a just amazing and fast phone. best in Iphone series. Face detection work awesomely. Camera clarity is also goodcomparatively another phone. Happy with using i phone X.

iphone,4,"The phone is amazingly fast, photos are almost as good as a DSLR. Face unlock is great. The only downside is the very high price.Highly recommended if you're able to pay through the nose to one of the Telcos for the absurdly high priced plans (mine is a work phone, lucky me, otherwise I damn sure wouldn't be paying over $100 a month for ANY phone!).A product is amazing - you just need to carefully assess the value situation.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"This phone has one of THE best cameras I have ever possessed in a mobile phone, though I am not very happy that they got rid of the Touch ID as it makes the phone less practical.

iphone,4,"The iPhone X is overall a good phone. I have not had any problems so far, yet I have only had it for 3 months. The camera quality is the best out of all the other iPhones I have had.

iphone,4,"I purchased my iPhone X in November 2017.Generally speaking, it done what it is suppose to.

iphone,3,"The good bits: Face ID - love it.  Enhanced camera functions.Not so good: Quite heavy.  Storage options are limited.  Closing apps and screens has an extra step required (from previous phones and current ipad) - unnecessary and annoying.The bad: Overpriced for what it delivers.  Not much to recommend as a ""flagship"" 10 year anniversary.  I'd had 4 iphones over 8 years and this is the most underwhelming.No headphone jack and NO ear-buds included in exorbitant pricing.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I LOVE this phone! Until now, I have mostly used my mobile for internet searching and a bit of social media. With such amazing quality on the iPhone X cameras, I have stopped using my DSLR and now use my phone solely for all photography. The AR is amazing and the available    AR apps work seamlessly on this phone. I have friends with other brands and see considerable lag on their phones. I wasn’t sure how I was going to cope without a home button and Touch ID but Face ID is AMAZING and the extra screen space is really great. I’m loving this phone and highly recommend it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,Good phone and much easier to use the shortcuts than the last versions. Takes a little bit of getting used to.

iphone,5,I love this iPhone because it’s  very unique and it is the newest iPhone. It feels fairly light and has a good colour. It’s  fast for playing games and isn’t slow like the other iPhones for gaming. I definitely would recommend to my friends and family without a doubt. The Touch ID I said very unique as well.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,I have an Iphone X and it's really good for your everyday needs. There's decent battery life and phone storage. There's sometimes hiccups when it struggles to recognise whether you are looking at the phone horizontally or vertically but you can turn that function off. The headphones have a different plug so if you have your usual headphone cord then you've got to plug it in a different connector to use your headphones. The headphone plug in this phone is also the power plug,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I don’t have one to give as the phone is great. I can not fault this phone as I work in age care and helps in every way posible. If I had to have a negative it would be the battery but I am useing and depending on it a lot.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,1,"When i first bought this, I thought that it looked like such a good looking device, glass all over and wireless charging sounded like I had finally caught up with my old Android, but alas I was disappointed again. The glass on all sides aren't gorilla glass, but are so Apple knockoff which purports to be stronger, but is more brittle and chips easily. The display is good, nothing you wouldn't get on a Galaxy S8, or hell even an S9. The real defining feature is its lack of things, lack of headphone jack, lack of fingerprint reader, lack of intelligence I had to have to think this was a good phone. Seriously though, who is this designed for? Its tech is so outdated, processor so slow, screen so Meh. At least the glass is nice. Also the camera tech on the front is from the company that made the original Xbox Kinect sensor, compared to the new one, that thing is a joke. Apple can you please for the love of God resurrect Steve Jobs, it will be your only chance of survival.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This is the best phone I’ve ever owned. The safety of the facial recognition is awesome. I use the Apple Pay feature on a regular basis and have never had a problem, rarely carry my wallet anywhere anymore. Easy to use for someone that isn’t very tech savvy. Will stick with Apple for all future purchases (even our iPad is used everyday). Just wish the screen didn’t get cut off for videos or apps that hadn’t updated for the X.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I really love the iPhone X. It’s smooth and responsive. The new gestures make it much quicker to get where you want to go and FaceID is heaps more convenient than TouchID. Only one issue: it’s too big. Doesn’t fit in any of the places that are normally designed for phones, like the specially designed phone compartment in my car. I guess when it was built phones were generally smaller. Can’t wait for an SE-sized X!",Productreview.com.au

iphone,5,"It was certainly a challenge working out this phone as it was quite different not having a home button but I love the changes and differences. The size for me is perfect, I almost got the bigger phone and I am glad I didn't. Apple has always been my go to with products, I have had no problems with it and the battery lasts a long time. I love the screen to edge screen, it makes the phone look really good. I overall love my iPhone X, amazing purchase.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I purchased my iPhone X back in January 2018.I had to update because my iPhone 6 pluswas dying and even after I had replaced the battery on the 6 plus it was still becoming clunky...but back to the X.Ticked all the boxes except a few.  I was almost disappointed in going back to the smaller hand set size even though the screen size more than makes up for it.  I think I was just used to the larger phone size.  However it didn't take long to get used to the size and face recognition.  It doesn't miss a beat (except for when I am wearing sunglasses which is a tad annoying). But a good safety feature none the less.Camera is much better, battery life is a dream compared to my 6 plus but in saying that it would be nice to go back to the days of not having to charge your phone every day.It feels well made and does everything it's supposed to do. I am absolutely loving the new 'portrait' mode in the camera.  It does take a really nice picture.However like all technology there are some glitches.  I have found (and asked other X users who have confirmed the same) that when sending multiple photos via iMessage that it freezes up and will only send one at a time.  This can be very frustrating at times.The phone works fast and meets my needs of working at a fast pace and needing it on the go. So far it really hasn't missed a beat.  But given it has only been used for 4 months you would expect a new phone to be just that.The cost was, in my opinion, very high.  I had to save my pennies for this one!I just hope that this phone continues to function like this for quite a while.  So fingers crossed!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,2,"I was happy with my iPhone 6, then suddenly it became so glitchy that I had to upgrade to iPhone X and fork out $1800 for no reason at all.

I feel Apple scammed me to buy this by slowing my iPhone 6 hence 2 star",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I've been an Apple iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and have loved all the developments they’ve included over the years.  Using the phone for work means having a complex pass code so when fingerprints become a authentication method it was so fast and easy.  Since the iPhone X now used facial recognition I find that I’m having to manually enter the passcode more often than the old fingerprint.  Simple use cases like unlocking the phone when in bed with your face half buried in a pillow, sitting in the car with the phone in a cradle on the windscreen are meaning more often having to manually enter a PIN whereas I never had this problem with fingerprints.  Other than that iOS is great and I love the features, cameras and processor speed.  Also like the integration into Apple watch.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The updates on this phone compared to previous iPhones makes a difference - it has become much more user friendly with closing apps, no home button, the Face ID unlock, it’s a very good size, it’s water resistant.

iphone,4,"Best camera and great phone has heaps of awesome features, awesome camera and video recording.

iphone,5,Where do I start everything about the iPhone X is fantastic especially having the ability to log in with your eyes to your phone and things like emails bank accounts that means no more passwords your eyes r your password! And we all know the finger print scanner does not work in the rain or when u get out of the shower or the pool or when u have gloves on so it’s a fantastic feature. The size of the phone is great as well and u have so much real estate as it’s and edge to edge display.just on display it’s fantastic very natural colours and easy to see in the sunlight. The design and build quality is great to so pop down and have a look at getting one you won’t regret it oh yeah apart from the price if that’s not an issue I’d say get one as it’s the best phone on the market at this point,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Was apprehensive when making this purchase due to the price tag, however I have no regrets. The Face ID is very intuitive and functions much better than expected.

But for something that is such an integral part of my daily life, I'm happy to spend the $.I hesitated with this model - was a big fan of Touch ID, and didn't like the idea of Face ID, but now it's one of my favourite features. I have gone from a 7plus to the X, so smaller phone, bigger screen. Very happy as I have small hands and it's easier to use. I do find it a big long though - lots of videos etc don't use the full screen which is a shame. Photos and videos are fantastic quality.Everything else is pretty much same as always. Shared calendars, notes and photo albums are great for our family, my life would fall apart without it!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Great phone to use, very user-friendly, quite hard in the beginning though since it comes without a home button. Great camera takes great photos and great videos as well. Incredibly light smartphone. The best piece of technology so far.However bought mine 3 weeks ago and has crashed already for no reason. Put it on charge the previous night before going to bed and woke up the next day and it was gone. Plugged into the charger few times a day and still nothing. I have to use my old iphone 6s while looking at fixing or replacing the iphone x. Apparently this issue is a common issue with this new piece of technology. Let me tell you, i have had the iphone 3 for 3 years, the iphone 5 for 3 years, the iphone 6s for nearly three years too, and never had such a problem with an iphone. My iphone 6s has never crashed, never crashed the screen and it works well until now. But i keep saying that the iphone x is a great smartphone. Apple just need to fix that crash issue and things should go pretty nice for this phone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Great smart device built with user experience in mind. Intuitive interface, clear and bright vivid screen, plenty of real estate. Web pages look great. Strong audio performance too make for interesting  multimedia performance. Owned for 6 months now. No issues with performance or lagging. Speedy start up and fast rendering make a great overal package",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Its understandable the top notch of all that Apple have made. Ok so there are a few flaws yes as every phone. Yet the positives highly outweigh the minute negatively. I enjoy the camera, its clarity and the ability for the phone to function as I'm having many screens open. Luv it. Full fan. But one",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The iPhone X is truly undefeated. It is so simple yet so intricate. It has everything you need and I will never go back! I use this phone for everything in my daily life, it’s replaced all my other gadgets. Not to mention how safe it is , with the new Face ID.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"This phone provides facial recognition which is a more personalised approach compared to just the fingerprint scanners. The camera quality achieved is excellent with great detail and allowing to focus on images in a precise manner. There are also added options of portrait and other features. Even so, battery length is considered average with it lasting a full day but without excessive use.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I really like my iPhone X. I like being able to use gestures such as swiping the bottom edge to switch between apps. So much so that I keep doing that gesture on other people’s older iPhones too LOL.It’s got a great camera too.I just think it shouldn’t be so damn expensive. It’s way too overpriced for what it is.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"It is an Iphone yayy. Can't fault it. It has been excellent. Upgraded from iPhone 7s so it is a big improvement.The only bad things I can find is the price. these phones are expensive. paid mine 1400+dollar. The iphone X accessory are expensive too compared to other model. Overall, love it, can't live without it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Definitely not worth the money that they charge you. I own a vast amount of Apple products. I bought 3 iPhone X’s all in protective cases. One was put in an otter box protective case that was recommended by Apple employees.A few months after purchase the phone fell off a table not more than half a metre high and the back glass on the phone shattered. It’s was such a small fall. The camera glass was fine. Spoke to Apple about fixing it and apparently you have to replace the entire phone at $800+AU if you don’t have Apple care which is $300 AU plus $100 to replace the phone, which is half the price of replacement if you don’t have Apple care.Prior to this accident the faceId camera was not working on this phone. Apple wouldn’t even look at it and their diagnostics apparently don’t tell them anything about this issue and how long it has failed for which is convenient for them. Now they refuse to open the phone because the back glass is broken.Apple have become the biggest joke in the industry building inferior products all the while increasing their prices dramatically.I would recommend an iPhone 8 or another brand of phone. I Would never recommend the iPhone X To anyone. It is just not worth even half of what they charge for it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This iphone x is the best phone I have ever usedI really like the edge which a largen your screenIt works fine and the size is just fits for my jeans pocket, the only thing that i do not like is I bought the 64gb one, I should buy the 256gb oneI also like how the iphone app detect my face to different animals as it is so funny! Hope this will help.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"it's pricey, but it is the best iphone, i have used.  The Face id works like a charm.  gone are the days, when I have to enter passwords for each and every damn app, face id just unlocks it. It works also in dark. the camera is excellent and so is the quality of the pics.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,LIke guys seriously the iPhone x is so good. I know it's pricey but it worths. The shape is amazing. However material made it become a little bit slippery. If you don't use a case yah you might need to pay a new screen...The function is good. The camera is super nice!!!!,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"So after getting the new iPhone it had everything included which was awesome as I’ve always had a second hand phone. I love the way it feels, the way it runs, takes photos & videos. I’m in love with the big screen and the battery life is so great! I’ve recommended it to everyone!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,2,"I recently purchased iPhoneX via optus 12 month plan. I am paying $140 after 25% student discount. While I got addicted to the new bigger screen quickly soon I realised its not worth the price. Surely will be sustainable as it is an apple product, but iphone 7/8 does the same job at a much lower price.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I love most things about this phone. The big screen is great. The face recognition is fantastic (when it works, most of the time.) The face recognition auto fills passwords for you and gives you access without a pin. It does seem to take ages to charge but I don’t often run out of battery so I guess that’s ok. Most important to me is that the camera is good. I think it’s fantastic, with the only drawback being that sometimes moving subjects blur. One issue that I have had is that my initial restore never fully completed and I unfortunately lost a small amount of data, which occasionally is problematic. Another issue is that the uploading of photos to iCloud never seems to fully complete either, so my shared photo streams aren’t updating. Overall though I am happy with this purchase.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Ok so I currently have an iPhone X through Vodafone but the only downside to this phone is the fact that the whole phone is made out of glass, like super super THIN glass. I had my phone for around a month before it fell on the floor (with a case and screen protector on) and the whole thing shattered to pieces. I was unable to use it at all as little pieces of glass were coming out, worst part is that Apple apparently couldn’t repair the back of the phone and I would have to pay $800 for a new one through them, thankfully since it’s imsured I got it way cheaper through my phone company. Still very scary since you are paying $1000 upwards for a phone and it breaks with one small drop, needs sturdier glass :(",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,The iphone X is a very similar version to its previous models which makes me wonder why a person would spend so much on a new phone. However an apple is an apple is an apple. The focus alot on the camera which should not be the only point of focus.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The screen is large enough to let me watch videos and the surface looks really professionalBut one of the thing is I cannot use the normal earphone, i need to put an adapter in. There’s a lot of option of phone case i can choose which is really good as i used android previously and there’s not much phone case option that i can choose",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The iPhone X is a great phone, Apple try to innovate each year and they did kind of do it. The iPhone X is a lot different to previous versions. I guess that the iPhone 8 is the safe version and the iPhone X is the innovative one. Great device, not sure if it is worth the $2000 price tag.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,The iPhone X didn’t exceed my expectations but I did come to like it. The best thing about the new phone is the lack of home button. You don’t realise how convenient it is to just swipe up and not have to press down on a home button until you go back and use the older iPhone models.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Pros:An outstanding cameraA long lasting battery life (although Apple's current slowing down of phones scandal is something to think about)Very fast at performing tasksSlim bezels (notch is no longer noticeable after using for a couple of weeks or so)Great customer service.Cons:Still prefer touchiDNo headphone jackStill a wonderful phone though,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,I bought this phone around 2 months ago. I think it is a great phone but not the 1500 dollars I spent on it. I don't like the fact that is doesn't have a home button on all phones should have. but it shows no signs of slowing down and if your looking for a long lasting phone this is definitely worth it.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Have been using for 2 months now, and this phone is phenomenal. The design is nice and slim, the screen is very vibrant and the minimal bezels are awesome. The notch is not as bad as people say it is as I didn't notice it after using it for a week. The camera is awesome, with DSLR level quality photos and the face id is a lot.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Have used it for a monthmayprosvery fast, excellent customer support from apple, no lags, the bazzels look awesome, face id, very good battery life, amazing cameraconsno headphone jacks, have to use itunes for everything cant just transfer files like android, no fingerprint sensor, very expensiveI may never go back to android and i hope apple continue to upgrade this model.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Love everything about this phone except the price tag. Screen looks beautiful, performance is awesome, camera takes crisp photos and the phone is so easy to use. Would I recommend it over the iPhone 8/8 plus? Only if you can afford to cough up $1,579 + accessories to protect the phone!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Upgraded from a iphone 6. Took a while to get used to no home button, but seems obsolete now. Face id is really handy when trying to access phone when your hands are full. Portrait mode on the camera is a big bonus. Larger screen area good, and it comes with a headphone jack so not having to buy this was a nice surprise. Love it",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I have always enjoyed the basic and easy way of iPhone's but have always wanted to change brands as the camera quality was always the same with each new design. Yet as the iPhone X came out i got it and was blown away, it was actually really good and i'm honestly really pleased with it as a apple product.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I know how I ever got by without this phone. Absolutely amazing! It is easy to use, stylish, heaps of apps available and I love all of the colours. Apple has done a great job in the development with the phone. I tell all of my friends that they need to get one.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Totally worth the price. I got mine on launch day from optus and was instantly blown away with this phone, i had upgraded from the iphone 6 i immediately was able to adapt the the loss of the home button and am quite happy without it. I love the face ID and have never had a problem with it, it quickly adapts to changes such as sunglasses. the Camera is amazing and takes the best photos effortlessly, features are great and the phone fits in the palm of my small hands easily. I would never go back to another style of iphone and i hope apple continue to upgrade this model.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,My recent purchase of the iPhone X is my fourth Apple iPhone and each model has been a delightful improvement in both capability and capacity.  I really like it’s intuitive operating system and the new added gestures make it even easier and faster to use. It is robust and easy to handle and I have no complaints regarding its design or operation. Great product!,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Love it, love it, love it. Really good phone, has so many features, nice and smooth, touch works great, Apple has really stepped up in this model only screen size needed to be little larger but I still love it, it’s really excellent phone to use and has excellent camera too.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Good Phone better than previous models however one thing I am not happy is the camera at the back is not flat so if you put the phone down it will first hit/scratch the camera lens thus very disappointing. Otherwise, the camera is good, features are great nothing to complain compared to S8+ android phone. Small handly fits in palm",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Great camera, takes good quality photos even when the subject is moving it still tends to get a clear pic. Nice big screen. Torch is brighter than previous iPhones. Very responsive. Lock screen can be a buggy sometimes (when entering passcode to unlock screen). All in all pretty happy with this phone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Get it on the plan. It's good but however, at this price, you have to ask for a higher standard.- The face ID doesn't work perfectly. At least not as smooth as the touch ID- Many apps don't support the screen size- Why can't we have 128Gb?",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"i got it from a phone plan, but I wouldn’t buy it and spend $1500 on it while I can get other phones with the same features for less. After a while, the phone also starting to slow down. What I like about it though is the high def display.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"As I said, love the screen and camera. Camera significantly improved especially in evening shots. But the phone still has lots of bugs, hence my rating.Sometimes it glitches when I need do answer the call, it doesn't want to swipe. Otherwise very responsive, but overpriced smart phone. Thanks.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Love my Apple products and this new addition has some added bonuses from the past phones. The security features, ease of use and the nice slim design is what Apple is known for. The device works very well, is fast at processing and has an awesome battery life (always could be better).",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Definitely recommend this phone has been the best iPhone so far, If you’re wanting a better camera and a smaller phone also lighter with better battery life suggest looking at this. You’ll be happy with the outcome.  Was thinking about Samsung but if you’re an apple person stay all Apple.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Apple has finally made an improvement with this iPhone, more memory, better camera, greater features & a much larger screen to make things clearer. I am finally loving my new iPhone, after missing the home button for a week or two, I have become used to it not being there.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,just bought the iphone x recently with my friend. I would recommend buy a case that is strong enough to protect the phone or it could break. But the features are mind blowing and is extremely worth its price like the Animoji like that is the best and the Face ID is also awesome,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I actually thought that I wouldn't like this phone, but i am totally in love with it. It takes a little bit to get used to the fact it has no home button, and all the new gesture controls you need to learn, but once you do there is no turning back. I really love the face ID as well.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,1,"I don't want to change my other appliances to use only iPhone, its not supporting any smart TV, not supporting phone operated light , in fact cant be used with other products, still have very common issue cant even set my favorite ringtone, I phone X not easy access .",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"It was my first purchase of Apple phone , I already have a Galaxy S8 from Samsung.Apart from notch at the top I have nothing to complain about this phone. Excellent build, superb software and excellent all round performance.Battery could have been a bit better for a heavy user like me, especially when my Samsung outruns this phone on a busy day.I would recommend this phone to anybody who wants to have a great smartphone up their sleeves.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,It’s great if you love the iphones.Had to watch YouTube to learn how to find functions on the phone. They need to come with basic instructions for new models like this.Still only standard ring and text tones. They need to update this feature with new sounds and more wall papers,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"One of my friends recently got the new iPhone X and we took some random photos but they all turned up amazing. The quality is outstanding. However, I do have a concern with the Face ID. WHat if you had an identical twin. In 5 seconds they could swipe you phone and look through everything. Or if you had a photograph of the owner, if you held it up to the camera, would it unlock?",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"It is beautiful phone, elegant design and I am happy with that, I always fan of apple product.Phone is fast, battery is good.i like the design , my old phone from Apple as well but with this model I can not imagine how amazing! I love this phone because the resolution is high qualityThanks Apple design iPhone X",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"It is a very expensive phone but it is definitely a great phone, it has some amazing features such as the animoji and portrait camera. The storage is absolutely amazing and it is so much easier to use face I.D. instead of fingerprints and passcodes. Without the home button it looks like it is from the future.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I find the iPhone x an excellent product which has great performance over other phones I have used. The graphics are excellent and it takes fantastic photos. The feature such as face recognition are excellent and one I particularly like is when the phone rings and it know I am looking at the phone the volume reduces automatically.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I am an Apple fan so I can be a little bias. This is only because all my other electronics work and talk together harmoniously. Face ID is good but not a real selling point. Screen resolution itself is very bright and vibrant - love the colour output it gives. Animoji is a gimmick, but fun nonetheless. Wireless charging is convenient but slow. If you're looking to upgrade but without the price tag, I'd go for an iPhone 8. I just like the X because it was the latest model!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,The apple iPhones are the best I just love them.I have 5 and 6 waiting to get the next one .The features are so easy to manage. I recommend to everyone.However I have heard that with the 10 you have to buy all the extras from iphone which I wont be getting.As all other iphones the bluetooths universal can be used so skip the 10.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I'm the first to admit that I enjoy my Apple products. My HomePod has been a wonderful addition to the house (would be better if Siri worked), and I love my MacBook Pro and iPad. There are limitations with all of them, but I'm happy with them nonetheless.With the iPhone X, the price is quite high, although let's be honest, it's not that much higher than flagship phones from some other manufacturers. If you want a cheaper phone, there will of course be other phones that will do the job for you. But if you use your phone a lot, as I do, then it can be worth paying more.Most of the changes in this phone don't make that much difference to its use. The extra screen space (without much of a bezel) is brilliant, and immediately made the old iPhone display look dated to me. The notch is... weird. I mean, why not just have a slight bezel on the top? But they made the choice. Knowing that some Android manufacturers would follow, Google has baked in notch support into the latest version of Android. It's a puzzling design decision to me, but it really doesn't get in the way very often. Occasionally in a full screen video, but not very often.Face ID is great. It works most of the time, although on occasion I find myself still having to use the pass code.Getting used to the new controls, without the home button, has taken a little bit of getting used to. Accessing control centre is done by swiping from top right, which is impossible one handed. That's a strange choice to me, too.It's fast. No lag on anything, really. And seeing apps running full screen on this thing, because of the large display, is awesome.I've heard a lot of people complaining about the price, or some of the features. If it's not for you, it's not for you, and that's OK. But if you're after a great looking phone that can do a lot of stuff very fast, has access to a lot of great apps, and you have the spare cash, go nuts.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Apple need a reality check. I wish the buying public would give it one.This phone was bought outright for me as a present. I was considering switching to Samsung who still pretend to care about their customers. Apple Australia couldn't give three-tenths of a pooh about their customers anymore.It's an okay phone. If it were half the price, I'd recommend it. But at $1700, pfft.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I love it just upgraded from an iPhone 5 and can't live without it great camera and really simple to use my wife is totally jealous and I will probably going to have to update her phone but that is the only real down side. The slim design and compact design is what really got me interested in the first place.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I waited for years to upgrade to the latest iPhone and am not disappointed. It takes a short while to adjust to the lack of a home button but once you get used to it there's no turning back. This is a very slick phone, a bit pricy but probably worth it",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,i love the slim design and ease of use with the iPhone ....as I cannot read clearly the iPhone is great as it allows me to enlarge the txt large enough for me to read without putting my reading glasses on everytime I get a message...there is enough storage for me to download heaps of apps and to take lots of phots and videos which I do frequently...the camera has a good zoom facility although the picture quality does diminish with the zoom but otherwise the pics are great quality I would like a few more editing features though.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Its incredibly fast, great design, Face ID works like a charm (even in the night...when there is less light) I personally love the camera, the quality of the photos and videos are amazing. The notch was something I wasn't a big fan of. However, its amazing how quickly I got used to it.I do wish I bought the 256GB version...with amount of 4k videos I take, the phone fills up quite fast.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,Love iphone X !! Really fast and incredible camera quality. However can sometimes crash which isn't all that well but generally is a very good product. I really like the large display and is a good change from the previous iphones.Also thhe size of this iphone was perfect for me too as I felt like the ihpone+ of other models were just a tad too big for me. I have a love-hate relationship with the side of the phone though and think they couldve improved by having perhaps gold/ rose gold as a colour option.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I love Apple product using from last 8 years.in iPhone X it’s amazing the shape.specially no buttons on front.face id function is amazing no body else can touch my phone without me.my wife try to open even she try when I was sleeping but because my eyes was closed so she couldn’t open it.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"some summary of this product- very very very very expensive- very fast- apple- OLED display ( this is very good ) , wide display- new UI- wireless charging tech.- face recognition tech.In my opinion this is not perfect and JOBs's style but it's good",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The iPhone x is a very high quality and very special to use and a lot more new features to useThis a special phone because the brand new features like face ID,animoji and much more as with all Apple it's easy to use made from delicate materials thanks for reading",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"As with all Apple phones, they are very easy to use and they are generally built with high quality materials, but also like all Apple products, the iPhone X is extremely expensive, despite all of its features, they are not really worth it for the price Apple is charging. If the phone was $200-$300 cheaper it would be significantly more worth it but I could only recommend it for people that could justify spending over $1000 on a phone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,The iPhone x is a beautiful phone with the brand new face id and animoji that has been released by Apple. It also has 2 cameras for taking better photos. Thee photos I take with my iPhone x are crisp and clear! Overall this is a great product though it is quite expensive.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Great screen, excellent quality. However I believe the speed and performance could be improved a lot in the next iPhone made! I believe something can be done however apart from that the overall sveeen and no home button is amazing! More variety of colour would be good also! Overall would give 8/10",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I can’t really fault the iPhone X except for a few minor things. I bought the 256GB model, and it is excellent. Zippy, fast, responsive. The screen is beautiful, although Apple cites “edge to edge” but it really isn’t. It’s kind of full screen, but with very noticeable black bezels. Just compare it to the Samsung S8 or S9 with the curved edges. This is what I had expected Apple to do with the iPhone X, but they didn’t. Maybe they are saving it for a future release.The other issue is the beautiful screen, which unfortunately is very prone to micro abrasions. Remember the Jet Black iPhone 7? They warned us that the back might be subject to microabrasions, so we were prepared for it. They did not warn us about the screen on the iPhone X, and having used it for a few short months in my pocket which has nothing else in it, there are noticeable micro abrasions, and when I approached an Apple store staff member, they were unable to help or swap out the device. overall happy with it, but few small annoyances, which may or may not be ironed out in future releases.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Been using it since the day of the launch. It's pricey, yes, but it's a really fast phone, powerful, with amazing display. iOS is getting old for sure, but I have no complaints in a way because the apps are almost always better than the Android's.FaceID works great though it limits the way you unlock your phone on certain occasions like when you lay the iPhone on the table, or that you have to hold it facing you to unlock. Apart from these, it feels natural to unlock the phone.If you are not tied to the Apple Ecosystem, however, other flagship Android phones are great options as well as the camera can definitely compete with the iPhone X",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"This iPhone I found to be good like every iPhone although I don’t like having he facial recognition, I would’ve preferred the fingerprint like the previous model, the camera is amazing and the screen is crystal clear, phone does seem to run quicker hold charger longer and even charge quicker then previous models.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"As someone who has always been an iPhone user, I found that I wanted to try a Samsung to switch things up.

iphone,5,"Bought iPhone X - 64GB Silver as an upgrade from iPhone 7 in Dec 2017.Love it. Bigger screen size than plus version, Impressed with the dimensions, better battery life, better camera and more features. But got disappointed with the tiny scratches on the beautiful flawless stainless steel rim even with the apple genuine case with leather inlay. Its easy to get scratches on the sides - friction between tiny dust particles getting in to case and steel.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Got this phone as an upgrade from iphone 6s plus. Physically it feels like you are holding something that would shatter to a million pieces if you drop it. So you have to invest another $65 for a shock proof case. The screen resolution is good but the size is underwhelming especially the i am used to the screen size of the iphone6s plus. Camera is quite awesome. I also loved the face id feature. It is fast and works even in the dark. Performance wise it is quick and i havent experienced any lag yet.The only con is the price. Its too expensive and it should have wireless headphones and wireless chargers for the price.Buy one if you want to be up date with the trends and yoy have money to spare. If not, there are other cheaper phones that can do the same job..",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"I didn’t really like the iPhonex, I don’t know is it only me or for everyone. The battery lift is really poor. I bought it because my iPhone6+’s battery won’t last for a whole day so I bought this one but the battery lift for iPhonex is even worse than my old iPhone6+, when I checked in setting for battery usage it shows 40000+ days so I took it to apple store and checked if there is anything wrong with my iPhonexs battery they said the usage date is a bit wired but there is no problem with my battery and didn’t replace for me.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I had read other review on this phone and was a little dubious as to if I would like it. As soon as I started using the phone I loved it! Didn’t have any issues with getting used to not having a home button, love all the features and found them very easy to use. The only criticism I have is that you can’t display the battery percentage on the screen but that isn’t really a huge deal",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Apples tech just gets better with each phone, however I dislike not having a earphone home. Takes great photographs, great app storage. Sleek stylish look along wth the large screen makes perfect for playing games, taking pictures or streaming movies on Netflix. Great for all young and older generations especially with large screen making it easier to see",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Camera is great, there’s plenty of options to edit the picture. The Portrait option is the best. All of the photos I captured using this option are great.But phone is too heavy compared to other phones. Would have been better if its lightweight. Sometimes the Face Detection doesnt work as well, I have to enter the passcode.If I’ll be given a chance, I would purchase the iPhone 8+ instead of the iPhone X.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,Best phone yet! So easy to use and has everything you need. The camera quality is fantastic too. I love being able to have a great camera on my phone rather than having to purchase a camera as well. The phone is super slim and lightweight as well! Love it!,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I love the iPhone X.. Incredible display, incredible sound, incredible long battery life.. I can actually get through the day now with my battery. IF ever I have used my phone that much, I actually use the battery throughout the day, the quick charge, allows the battery to very quickly charge to 50% if anyone is looking at a phone, I highly recommend this one.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Expensive phone - but stunning design, beautiful display and fast processor.Touch screen is a breeze to use, much more sensitive than the previous models, the Face ID works well however sometimes during cold or hot weather extra protective clothing - it struggles to recognise my face.Without a physical 'home' button using the phone seems more immersive - however there are still many apps out there that require the home button - it becomes annoying as you have to 'make it appear' each time you need to use it.Will recommend to others who are willing to pay for the high price!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"When the iPhone X was announced, I knew I had to have it.A lot of people have criticised Apple for copying Samsung’s Galaxy 8 with its next to nothing bezel but Apples iPhone X’s screen takes the cake. There is pretty much no bezel, meaning the the screen is displayed edge to edge (besides the “notch” at the top where the camera and receiver is located).I bought this phone on launch and have received a few malfunctions here and there. A few given examples were sometimes viewing a website in Safari, the search bar would move higher up to the phone (where the time and signal bar is) and you’ll need to force quit the program to rectify the problem. It’s not a common occurrence, which is fortunate.iPhone users will know the iPhone has a function where their battery displays a “percentage” of the battery life and a better understanding on how long before they should commence charging. iPhone X “does” have this feature but it’s not constantly shown on screen. A simple swipe from top to bottom of the screen would drag down a taskbar which will then display this percentage. Not really an ideal move for me but I can understand why this needed to be done as there is no space for it to be displayed on the top right corner.Minor problems aside, I took this phone with me to Japan for my honeymoon and I took quite a few photos. I was never good at taking photos but I gave my phone to someone who was in the same tour as I was and he took a photo of me and my wife. Apparently, there is a portrait option which focuses on the subject and blurs out the background.If the phone is being used for a lengthy time, the back starts warming up. I’m assuming this is a normal occurrence.Now, a new feature on the iPhone X which the previous models never had is the face ID. This replaces the old fingerprint scanner as the iPhone X obviously doesn’t have the famous home button. The success rate for the phone to detect my face is 99.8% of the time. The face ID will also detect in pitch black as I always use the phone before I go to bed. Most of the time it does not detect in the morning, most likely because I just woken up and my face is still in the tired state.If for any reason, face ID does not detect you, then you have a backup 6 digit pin that you input.The face ID also have the moving emoticons. These can be used for messaging your friend instead of the traditional texting. It detects most facial movements, winking, moving your mouth etc. it records your voice as well. Although, older iPhone models do not have access to this feature, they can still view it.These are just some of the small selection of features and minor issues with the phone but all in all, it’s a great phone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I love this phone so much. It is so great and so easy to use. The camera takes stunning photos! I have always supported Apple products ever since I had owned my first iPhone 3. I have not had any bad experience with my iPhone X and do recommend, especially is you love to take great quality photos",Productreview.com.au
iphone,1,I purchase I phone X after last iphone i used iphone 5s.I left iphone because android is too advance than ios.because of all marketing and crazy people i brought iphone x 256gb.I don't like it at all compare to android. Most of the feather was already used in android and they are much better.Not recommended specially for the price. Going to sell and buying samsung galaxy s9.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Face ID works almost every time. Fast CPU and I had used both Pixel 2 and Samsung Note 8. I will prefer X any day of the week. The only issue is few Apps require home Button it is a bit annoying to use it.  The camera is excellent and sound quality is the best.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"It's a great iPhone iteration, with bigger screen space and Face ID. I don't miss the home button and I didn't like Touch ID, I actually find Face ID much more reliable, a glance is enough to unlock my phone or take a look at recent notifications. Display notch is actually not irritating, but a distinctive feature which many other phones now try to copy. Great performance, nice camera and I love wireless charging.I have to say though, Apple is really testing our wallets with iPhone X prices.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Love Apple products, the way they are streamless, integrated and look good. But this version of the iPhone I feel is trying too hard. I’m not a fan of the face recognition, it doesn’t work in dimlit areas or if someone else wants to look at phone they have to repeatedly put in passcode (whereas iPhone 8 could save their finger print). It feels heavier and not as conveniently sized as the iPhone 6 upwards. Still a good product but with dramatic differences which are difficult to adapt to.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"As an iPhone fan since iPhone 4 release, I love the IPhone X with the full screen, metal frame  and a glass back. The phone looks elegant. I feel like holding a real phone, unlike other phones which are like toys. Love the Face ID function that makes login so easy. There are more to list for this excellent phone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Feeling very underwhelmed. Great for the bigger screen in a smaller phone than the plus, however the loss of the home button is very frustrating. Facial recognition is hit and miss and required you to be actually looking at your phone which means unlocking the phone is delayed. I miss the home button where the finger print meant, the phone was unlocked before you even looked at the screen. The ani-emoji now aren’t even special with apps that can do the same.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Just love this iPhone X, it’s so amazing with its fancy features. Love the face reaconition feature, it’s so handy as you don’t have to remember your passwords.  The Huge Screen is excellent for playing games and watching movies when you need to pass time on the train. The camera is awesome and takes brilliant pictures. I would recommend this product to anyone and I also had the best service from Myers Melbourne.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Initially I was reluctant about the iPhone X but after using it I would say its the smoothest phone I have ever used. Don't missed the hone button at all, except for touch ID which was much better. Face ID sometimes doesn't work in dark conditions and it can get annoying, hopefully they will fix in the next generation.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I've skipped out on the last couple of iPhones since there didn't seem to be much difference in hardware, but I'm glad Apple changed the iPhone X up. The screen is huge, without a border taking up space and really the perfect size for my tiny hands. I love the facial recognition and the camera quality is excellent. Very useful and fast but most importantly, the battery life is quite extensive for an iPhone. Definitely the best iPhone I've ever owned.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I love my iPhone X. The big screen is such a huge difference. It is easy to use, and excellent for games. Face ID is a game changer. Whether if i'm in low light or in the peak of day, Face ID can still recognize me. Amazing! Must buy for any phone user.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I have had the iPhone X since it’s release and I am so pleased with it, Apple has really outdone themselves! The Face ID feature which replaces Touch ID is almost infallible, so I’m unsure why people seem to have an issue with it.The phones design and the material used in construction is of the best quality and you can really tell when holding the device in your hand. Apple is known for quality hardware and they have not disappointed in this iteration of their flagship mobile phone.One tip though, I bought the 256GB version but if you don’t use the camera so much, maybe stick with the 64GB. With iCloud backup and image file compression built into the iPhone, you will probably get away with the 64GB. I have used 42GB so far and I consider myself a power user with lots of apps and images.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"If you want a phone that will turn heads then this is it. If you want a phone that has a beautiful then this is it. Great camera, Beautiful display but I still miss the headphone pack. I own 5 pairs of $200 - $500 headphones that I can't use with this phone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The Apple iPhone X is a great phone, the X is new and innovative. Let's start with the camera. It is breath taking and brilliant. I have owned an S7 and it beats the by a mile. There are added effects to make it look like a DSLR camera. Only sometimes would the fuzzy blurring not full capture the main focus of the image. The phone is quick and sharp. What you would expect from an iPhone. The specs are good, but as apple make iOs it is that much amplified. The face id is fast even though I prefer touch Id. The only little annoyance is the notch, but once you get past that you have a beautiful phone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Really nice phone, impressed with faceID. Battery is good but could be better. Overall beast phone. Would I recommend? If you can afford, go for it. iPhone 8's are just as good in my opinion. I've experienced minor lags once a while, a quick update fixed it. 10/10 Love it",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"I've had every version of the iPhone and although the X is great, its not worth the $$$ compared to an iPhone 6 Plus.Had my iPhone 6 Plus not have vanished recently, I think it would have done me for another 5 years at least.Save your $$$ and wait for some real improvements !.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Great phone, some big changes to get used to compared to the old iPhones. The gesture controls are cool to use. Only thing I hope they change is not being able to use the hover button to shut down the X. Oh, and a couple of dollars cheaper would’ve been great too. ;) LOL",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The edge to edge screen is amazing, with OLED you can really see the difference compared to the older iPhones. The best feature would have to be the camera, shooting in portrait mode produces beautiful photos and the 4K video is crystal clear. Highly recommend this phone to suit anyone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I have been a long time user of Iphone, from the first one. I was still using my 4 year old Iphone 6 plus and was very happy with it and initially a bit reluctant to pay the price for the X, I was also considering switching to Samsung. Eventually went for the Iphone X and I am super happy with it, it really exceeds what I was expecting. Everything feels faster, more clever. There is nothing 'very' new about this versus older models, but everytyhing just feels better: screen quality, switching between apps, and a lot of smaller new features that I personnally find very cool. I initially was not convinced with the 'new' headphone format (no classic headphone jack(, whereby you are forced to go wireless or to use their small adaptor, but it works ok and I dont see if as a major negative in the end, just need to get use to it. I also noticed people complained about the 'no home button', but I think it is actually great and feels like a very well integrated device.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Got the iphone x for christmas. My last phone eas an iphone se bought in 2016. I was happy with my SE because of the compact size and didnt want a larger phone. However, I am hooked on my iphone x. It’s larger, yet sleek and handy. Gets a bit warm when charging, but haven’t noticed any problems. Love it!",Productreview.com.au

Decided to buy this albeit expensive and very happy with the built quality of the phone. Love the new screen, it is very sharp and clear. I missed the touch ID at first but I can live without it now. I still feel we need card reader so I hope they will get a card reader slot for the next iPhone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Face ID is excellent.  It works perfectly. I had read so many negative reports about it which made me uncertain about the purchase.  But I went ahead and bought one.  I am so please I did.  The most important reason for my purchase is that Touch ID will be so outdated by September this year.  I have 256 GB because I also feel with new technology constantly evolving I will need loads of space. Why I upgraded to a X from 5s 32GB, apart from its’ sluggishness, was the lack of GB.   I am thrilled with my X.  And it did not take long to get used to the great new features.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Very happy with the iPhone X, it’s the perfect size and big screen due to the edge to edge display.The oled display is truly stunning and screen resolution is the best out there I believe.However Face ID is definitely not as fast and reliable as Touch ID, and truly miss not having Touch ID. Only reason I’d consider the iPhone 8 over the iPhone X is to retain the Touch ID.",Productreview.com.au

iphone,3,"As usual, Apple comes up with a reliable product. However after using it for a few months I have to say, it falls short of my expectations. The screen is definitely too small and I need to charge the phone every day, just like previous models. I thought the screen is a lot more resistant and it's not, it scratches and I had to buy screen protector. I still find myself using iPhone 6 Plus quite often to watch movies and for a bigger screen real estate. Not having to deal with home button is FANTASTIC!!! They should've done it ages ago. Now...the wireless charging. First of all, it takes ages to charge the phone wirelessly. So the technology is not there yet in terms of going all wireless. I still use wired earphones and wired charging. Files, media transfer over iTunes is a lot faster compared to older models. Camera is a bit better, but not wow. It's ok, incremental evolution - nothing more nothing less. I hope this year model will have bigger screen and better faster wireless.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,The size becomes smaller but the screen is larger the before!I really love the feeling when I have it on my hand!I can say Iphone X is the best cellphone in the current market. It introduces new gestures which is quite convenient and the system is very fast!Highly recommended!,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I have always had iPhones and the iPhone X is by far my favorite. The camera on this phone is incredible and I love the fact that I can use face ID as well as touch ID. Wireless charging is so easy and convenient and the storage and battery life is insane. The only con to this phone is that it is a lot heavier than others and is easy to crack. Overall I am very happy and would recommend this phone.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The iPhone X is a pretty good phone in my opinion and i have had a few phones. The display is excellent and according to some review and specs it is not as good as the Google Pixel 2 XL. I would disagree, I have had both phones and the display is brighter, more crisp and supports HDR and Dolby Vision which for some reason the Google does not (big let down there folks). The processor is the fastest I have used. The only problem I have had is drop out of blue tooth connection when playing audio. Perhaps a firmware can fix this problem. Ofcourse the other problem is the top of the display and the bezel taking some of the display space for the camera, not sure why they didnt try a little harder to get rid of it, definitely noticeable.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"The apple iPhone x looks flash and trendy however functionality is really annoying especially with unlocking with face ID. The phone is easy to crack and is heavy also and the notch on the display is fairly annoying as it's a little black hole resting on the top of your phone. Your better off with an iPhone 8 plus model which is much more user friendly. Having said this, the phone is still powerful enough and useful for what you need to do for everyday tasks.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I have always had Sumsung but after going to Frankston Telstra speaking with them about the concerns i had with my mobile they started to explain the options i had explaining what the iphone can do and also with the iphone clasic watch i was so impressed Jason was amazing and very helpful,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I moved from android to apple about two years ago, and for someone who is a bit of a tech nerd, the X was a no-brainer. I was initially a little put off by the design, but after a couple of hours use, the notch is not even noticable. In fact, I personally rather like that the whole top of the screen isn't taken up by a status bar!The hardware is solid; FaceID works really well, and both front and rear cameras are excellent. I do find the screen picks up very light scratches incredibly easily; I've not dropped it once in the last four months, but I have a large number of glittering shallow scratches. I would recommend having a screen protector for this phone!That aside though, I do really like this phone. It is attractive and feels great to use.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I’ve been using an I iPhone since the 3 and must say I was quite excited with the prospect of the X.Was it worth the wait? Worth the upgrade?I’d say yes but the change hasn’t been as drastic as I’d initially hoped. The phone is notably faster than my iPhone 7 and the screen size upgrade was always going to be a positive in my books but the slight instability and some bugginess does taint the experience a bit. Most annoyingly, the camera quite often freezes whilst the app is active and needs to be exited and restarted to work again.The biggest difference (of course) is the removal of the home button. I thought it would take a while to get used to the absence of a physical button to navigate through the phone but behold, it only took a few days for the gestures to become second nature.Overall, nothing too surprising from Apple.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,The iPhone needs no introduction although perhaps the X does. It's apple's first foray into an OLED screen with no home button and they do a nice job.Having come from a plus size iphone previously it took some time to adjust to the smaller phone. Even several months after release I'm still finding I am making typing errors using the on screen keyboard. I would love a bigger version of this phone.The other issue is something I noticed that started with the 6s+. The screen is quite prone to micro scratching from unknown sources - it's not like it's sharing a pocket with anything else.The screen is simply fantastic and the camera takes amazing photos.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The best phone I have purchased ever. This iPhone was bought for my family. They really enjoy the iPhone and advise that the iPhone has a modern design and works excellent.

iphone,5,"It is quite expensive so I was hesitating to get it at first. The built is very nice and decent, love the big screen and the camera.

Battery life is decent.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The iPhone X is a real joy to use. It’s beautiful, the software works perfectly in harmony with the hardware and did I say it’s beautiful? The problem is that it is also the most fragile piece of technology I’ve ever owned. It took less than a day for the glass back to shatter. Less than two weeks until the front was split in half.

Cellular and WIFI speeds are quick, and the dual lens camera gives out crisp and colour-accurate photos.

The A11 chip is excellent - multitasking with various apps, emails and messages is an absolute breeze. This phone is a true pleasure to use. Apple have truly outdone themselves.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I upgraded from a iphone 8 64gb it is quite a nice step up in performance and screen size notch isn't that noticeable phone is however overpriced for what it is.

iphone,4,"As an iPhone 3GS user, since it will always use apple fruit powder, if it is not Samsung's bombing survivors, s8 listed, I am afraid to switch to Andrews camp, the idea of ​​millet mix2 listed a step further. Even after the Apple conference is over - iPhone X did not bring me any surprises, cancellation of the fingerprint is even canceled I once canceled the idea of ​​buying. After getting the real machine, there is only one idea in my mind, that is the value. iPhone X Color value is really tall. First of all, lock screen state, has been criticized by the bangs is not seen. I bought a dark gray, covered with glass backplane whole body seamless, do not worry about the paint off, Shu oil coating also inhibits the use of fingerprint retention. Apple iPhone hidden antenna 7, this is disappearing without a trace. After unlocking the picture to tell the truth I did not think so ugly, Liu Hai first look really not used to, but not very compelling, taking into account the technical constraints, do not cancel the front camera and photoreceptor case, this Seems the only solution.iPhone X took a lot of weight in the hands, the official release of the weight of 174g, weighs 30g more than the iPhone 7, weighs nearly 40g heavier than the iPhone 6, it seems that much more, but the actual use of the gap is still quite obvious. Streaking case, iPhone X significantly more in line with my sense of grip on the phone needs. Of course, iPhone X is not without its drawbacks. One thing I most want to say is that the iPhone X rear lens projection is too high tmd, almost double the iPhone 6. iPhone X glass backplane and full screen price is not low, compared to the older models are also more likely to be more bad, do not buy Care + without a protective case, the machine does have some burning hands. Color accuracy brought by the OLED screen In fact, the visual recognition gap is small, but the screen may have to say is a hidden danger.Accessories are also quite worth mentioning the issue, iPhone 7 launched by numerous people Tucao wireless headset does not seem to make Apple turn around. iPhone X support fast charging and wireless charging, but want to achieve the best charging speed, the need to purchase a separate USB-C power adapter + USB-C to lightning cable, the official website price of nearly 800rmb, wireless charging base also need 500rmb This price is the recommended third-party equipment prices, Apple's own upcoming charging board, the price probably only high not low). In contrast, wireless headphones that do not involve the core features seem less objectionable. Also do not know if it is my illusion, there is no antenna iPhone X signal seems a lot worse, glass backplane there is also a little fever problem. It seems that you want to have both Yan value and function, Apple probably still have some way to go.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I wasn’t even looking at buying a new iPhone but when this was released and the reviews started to come out I just had to. It took me a little while to find stock but when I got it I was mind blown.Just a super fast smartphone with great features.The facial recognition works great. The camera is superb. It now has wireless charging too (We gonna look back in the past and think cables were so primitive). Just love everything Apple is doing with those phones. The only downside is the price really, but if you look at it, most people spend A LOT of their time on their smartphones, so you’re spending for something you will use a lot, therefore I never regret spending this money outright.I highly recommend the iPhone X.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I love my iPhone X, but I would be lying if I said there weren’t issues. FaceID is terrible, no matter what anyone says. Yes, it’s fast, it’s perfect, in ideal conditions. The reality is, we are ALWAYS using the phone in other conditions. Glancing from across the table, quickly checking something down at our pocket, or curled over on a pillow in bed - the iPhone X will be unforgiving if you don’t hold it up nicely. So get used to using a passcode again. The notch is fine, I must admit - it hides away nicely in apps where it would be jarring (ie video) but it’s there showing your stats in simple apps like web browser where it doesn’t matter. The screen is long so you’re never focusing on the edges anyway when you’re say, reading. Other than those features, it’s an iPhone - if you’ve used one of the old ones, you already know the experience. One note tho: it’s quite heavy if you’re not used to a “plus” model.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"For the iphoneX, they added Face ID and higher resolution for cameras. that's really cool. However i still prefer the fingerprint ID as if you have your phone next to you on the table you cannot just reach out and unlock it like you can with fingerprint ID.

iphone,5,"Hats off to the engineering team at apple; the features they have introduced was completely unheard off before. Simple things like lowering the ringer substantially when you looking at screen - no one before Apple thought of this.Messaging with invisible ink (both parties on iphone X), animoji is cool.

iphone,4,"I am surprised to see such a high price on this phone. Not sure why people would over pay. My brothers and I began buying and upgraded to the latest iPhone since the very first version and the iPhone X is one the biggest changes that I can remember. Much like going from the iPhone 3GS to the 4 was or the iPhone 5 to the 6.The X model looses the Home Button and doesn’t have a the headphone jack like the 7’s. No big deal on the headphone jack. Sometimes I do prefer plugging a set in and not having to worry about Bluetooth.The lack of a Home button does take some time getting use too. It is really different with the swipe gestures but after a day or so you get use to it. Basically learning a new way to switch and X out of apps. I like it now after using it.The phone is fast, feels crisper than the 7. Safari is snappier and pretty much all the apps are.The phones size is somewhat like the 7, feels thinner but is a tad larger.If you can afford it, you will be happy. I played with the iPhone 8 and it feels quicker too.",Productreview.com.au

It is tough to hold this phone during long calls.Moreover, this phone had been a premium phone with premium pricing.

The display is immaculate and the camera is simply on another level.

If it were narrower I might be able to live with the fact that part of the screen is no display, but it is so wide, that it blocks your view in a lot of situations such as viewing a photo full screen, is just unacceptable.The camera is awesome. It's been rated the best phone camera for stills and it deserves it.A bit heavy and too thick, especially with case on, but acceptable.New gesture operation takes getting used to, works better in some scenarios but not as good in others (have to wait rather than almost instant response).",Productreview.com.au

Battery life is fantastic, the screen is great to view (there is slight blueish tone when viewed from an angle, however), the camera is fast and crisp, it's fast and snappy to use and looks great. It's everything good about an iPhone.The not so good… the glass back is a fingerprint magnet, the stainless steel band is too and looks like it will mark easily, and it still uses the Lightning connector rather than USB-C.Side-note: the notch isn't an issue and I actually sort of like it after using the phone for some time. Don't let it influence your decision.",Productreview.com.au

iphone,4,"The good bits: The iPhone X is easy to use, better to hold than my previous 6S Plus. Face ID works well (most of the time, it's quick to deny login if you've just woken up and haven't got both your eyes open...) Sound from the phone's speaker is loud and clear as well.The not-so-good bits: Apple Pay could be streamlined to use Face ID to pay rather than using passcode - which is pretty much the same as entering your PIN into the EFTPOS machine anyway. Accessing the torch and the swipe down menu from the lock screen is hit-and-miss, sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't - hopefully just a bug with iOS that will be ironed out.",Productreview.com.au

It takes clear shot photos and it looks very professional, by far one of the best cameras for taking photos.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I've had every single iPhone since it launched and the iphone X has been revolutionary for me. I've always admired the Samsung but not Android so to get the edge to edge screen with the Apple iPhone is UNREAL. My finger print recognition in the iPhone 7 was so hit and miss whereas the facial recognition on the X is almost flawless. Great for opening all those apps that used to require fingerprint access. Worth every cent when you consider how often you use your phone. Just do it !!,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I won't lie - the iPhone X comes at a hefty price; and you probably pay extra given it's the anniversary edition - I expect future models to come back down in price to compete with flagship models from other companies. Neverthless, there is no doubt that this is a well built phone - and it works.The build quality is superior. The combination of metal and glass feels premium. Although I recently damaged my phone, I can say that the cost of repair ($799 AUD) is ludicrous. Apparently, the design is such that any damage that exceeds ""screen only"" cannot be repaired and requires a full replacement... This is clearly a flaw. I luckily had it covered on insurance, but would recommend Apple Care if such an insurance policy is unattainable.The camera is breathtaking. It's incredible to see how far phone cameras have come, and the portrait mode works a charm - so much so that I now take all the photos for my workplace's social media (hospitality industry). Furthermore, it works well in low light, and the OIS helps with blur - especially for video.It is fast enough that I never notice it being slow, and the battery life is decent if you are careful with it. I usually have a powerbank on me so do not really think about it. The wireless charging is useful too - but the back of the phone can get quite hot when in heavy use or wirelessly charging. Luckily, it won't blow up.Finally, the display is the best iPhone display yet - the colours are pixel density is amazing. And the Face ID works a charm too.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,I purchased an iPhone X a month ago from Apple store. I was very excited about it in the beginning but it’s nothing so special about it. It has good camera and bigger screen compared to previous models but didn’t impress me very much. It also has facial recognition which is super cool. It is good but not fantastic.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I was due for an upgrade coming from a much older iPhone and was tossing up between the iPhone 8 or X. I went with the X for a few reasons,- Extra 1gb of RAM- Longer battery life- Better screenAfter using this device every day since I got it the day it came out, it has been great. Very fast and snappy and a thorough pleasure to use. The edge-to-edge screen is a nice touch and front camera and sensors aren't that intrusive and you easily forget they are there after some time.  However, the one annoyance with this device would have to be the face ID feature. It is simply inconsistent unless you are starring at your phone which is not always possible in all cases (e.g. if you wanna check your phone while it's laying on the table). I really do miss the ease of touch ID and hope Apple finds a way to implement it in the next iPhone. The other aspects of the phone are great and are what you would expect of using an iPhone with great and easy software design, quality materials used and great support. It is slightly over priced but if you can get it now for a bit cheaper it is worth it especially coming from a very old iPhone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"With the removal of the home button, the iPhone X represents possibly the biggest transformation of the iPhone to date. Fluid gestures have been introduced to allow smooth navigation of the phone, rendering the home button an ancient relic of the past.Touch ID has been replaced with the new Face ID and I can honestly say it has improved the overall experience. Authentication for apps and Apple Pay seems seamless, making the same authentication with Touch ID seem quite fragmented.The OLED display stretching to accommodate the entire phone really is a work of art with brilliant contrast and accurate colours. The dual camera on the back captures sharp and impressive images, and combined with Live Photos, more readily captures memories and experiences.Few minor issues - iOS 11 remains not without bugs which can sometimes hamper the overall experience and you might struggle with Face ID to unlock your phone if it's lying flat on a desk.Overall, the iPhone upgrade I had been waiting for.

Here are my top reasons: screen size (bigger than plus but phone is smaller than the plus) and camera quality is insane (I even took some work professional photos with it). Minor Drawback: Face ID - I had to get my phone replaced, as there were hardware problem, but Apple was happy to exchange it to a new one.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,Upgraded from the iPhone 6 so to me there are significant improvements such as the camera quality.The speed and response times are excellent and overall it is a pleasant phone to use.It took some time to get used to the facial recognition instead of fingerprint recognition and the absence of the home button but the facial recognition works really well.Few things I am still getting used to are how to clear the background running apps and also i keep accidentally taking screenshots as you now use the volume and lock button to take screenshots but for some reason the positioning of these buttons always means i take accidental screenshots.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Coming from an iPhone 6, the X feels like a breath of fresh air. Great speed and responsiveness in most apps. The OLED screen looks great (although some apps haven't updated to use the full screen).There are some of the more controversial features which I feel are a bit half-baked such as face ID and the notch on the top of the screen. Face ID seems like a compromise as they couldn't get the on-screen touch ID working. I much preferred touch ID as you're not always holding the phone in front of you when you want to unlock it (phone on table). The notch as well takes a bit of getting used to visually and if you are using a screen protector like me means that the screen protectors don't adequately cover the area and make it look obvious that you are using a screen protector.Being the most expensive phone on the market (not counting Vertu and other exotics), I would have expected more rather than just a luke-warm experience.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I really enjoy using this phone! I wouldn't necessarily recommend purchasing it if you own models 6 and onwards tho, as the differences arnt worth the hefty price tag.

iphone,4,"The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, but one that really paid off. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made.

As far as face ID it works great. People really need to stop slamming this feature. There is always the option of passcode if I prefer . However, I still feel silly and awkward using apple pay. Touch ID seemed more user friendly but it’s a small sacrifice.  as far as the screen it doesn’t seem as big as the iPhone 7+ and the actual phone seems heavier and felt easier to use in this respect. However I have big man hands. I imagine that this is something to get used to. And as far as the ‘notch at the top’, People Please! I Don’t ever notice it. People will troll on anything these days. Do you look at your hands when you hold the Phone? No. However, I still do miss my iPhone 7+ as far as screen and ‘watchability’ but I love the speed and dependability of the iPhone X. The GB aren’t an issue as I have cloud storage everywhere.Defentily a good phoneBrief Cons-COST and battery!!!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The highlight isn’t the screen, it’s the battery life! 64 gb memory is actually pretty decent, I barely use half of it. The screen is also perfect with the perfect sized phone. The only thing (well two) is that I do miss the button and fingerprint scanner, my face does not work at all times.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,2,My mom slipped her iPhone X from the chair and the screen cracked instantly. To repair we had to pay amazing 500AUD just for the screen replacement...  Make sure to get very good screen guard otherwise it might happen to you as well. Also it does not have fingerprint which is very not comfortable.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"With Iphone X, I am so excited the new full-screen and face ID features.  An excellent camera and cutting-edge face-scanning technology. Compared with Iphone6, the mobile phone runs faster, doesn't wait, and saves a lot of time. Another amazing feature is Animoji, you can record the live emoji of your expression.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Great Iphone with the face id being slightly more inconveniencing than touch id, such as unable to be upside down or sideways. Large screen, the notch does not bother me at all unless apps bleed up, thinking its all available space, otherwise i just think of it as a bit of extra screen to show time and date and carrier, although not having a numbered percentage annoys me, overall not bad phone otherwise expensive.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"While it is pricey, iPhone X makes it up by the classy design and snappy OS.The camera has been ramped up and there is a portrait mode, where you can take pictures with studio lightings and free bokeh effect straight from the camera. I got the 64GB version, but probably should have got the 256GB one.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"At least some improvements have been made in appearance than in the previous generations. The screen is bigger and the fuselage is smaller. It's waterproof, but it's out of touch in the water screen. It seems just to make the phone waterproof from a security point of view, not for underwater use. The use of new phones is not smooth, and there's a bigger memory single effect than it used to be.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Okay, so I do love Apple products, and this is really no exception.  Yes, it's expensive, and they are purely pricing it that way frankly because they can. Having said that it's a great phone, one of my favourite features is Face ID and least liked features is Face ID. Let me explain: Face ID is great when you're actively using the phone, e.g. holding it to unlock, signing into web sites 'just happens' as you're already looking at the phone and it scans your face and poof you're looking at your bank account details without blinking.  The downside is that if you have your phone on your desk or table and want to unlock it you can't because the camera / sensor at the top of the phone has to be directly looking at your face - where as with TouchID you could have the device lying flat and unlock it anywhere within fingers reach.  Seems like a small issue, but it does get annoying / requires a change in behaviour.  The additional features such as portrait and Animoji are magical. And the screen size is great, it has a screen as large as a ""Plus"" model, but the form factor of a regular model.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This phone is the complete deal. From it’s amazing screen size to its fins too sloth and compactness. This phone is suited for the everyday person or someone requiring up and beyond. Whether you are a student or the chief executive officer of a multi national company, this phone has it all.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I'm very impressed with the X. I was a bit. hesitant to upgrade as the reviews were kind of ""meh"" and it is pricey. It takes about two weeks to get fully used to the gestures and face unlock but then there's no going back. It really feels like the future. The OLED screen is just perfect and it feels really special to use",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Upgraded my iPhone 6s to iPhone X recently. Have to say that it is as good as it gets. The Face ID is revolutionary, works very quickly, sometimes even when you don’t really want to unlock your phone! However i still prefer the fingerprint ID as if you have your phone next to you on the table you cannot just reach out and unlock it like you can with fingerprint ID. That is the only negative, otherwise an excellent product.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I have had many iPhones in the past but this iPhone X is just so much better. The screen quality is really crisp and sharp. The main thing i love about this phone is the camera, especially portrait mode, it just makes the photo look so professional. Another good thing about this phone is the new Face ID feature which makes home button completely useless, it is so much easier to use your phone like this.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I upgraded from a iPhone 6 plus. The performance increase is night and day. Very fast and snappy, the removal of the home button resulted in an interface that very intuitive and the edge to edge screen is very nice. I can easily recommend this phone and don't think I would want to upgrade for at lease another few years.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Very good phone, face-id works great. The OLED screen is very good quality. The screen is now the perfect size and good for watching movies and reading PDF files. Wireless charging works great and can be left charging overnight and don't need to worry about charging cables. Overall highly recommended product.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"It is quite expensive. I do not think it is really worth its price. The screen is not big enough. I need set up the lettlers in very big vision. The battery perfermance is bad, it should better than previous iPhones but it is not.If I can choose again, I will not buy it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"My background: I've been an Apple user since the iPhone 3. I upgrade to the latest iPhone on average every 2 years with my last one the 6s PlusPros- Excellent OLED screen. I'm consistently impressed by the image quality when i look at my phone, especially how black the blacks are. This is surprisingly the most notable upgrade- FaceID is easy to use and works well under many conditions- Removal of the home button is definitely the right direction for the design language of iPhone. The replacement swipe actions are very intuitive and there is barely any learning curve. I easily got used to it within a few minutes. The home button just feels old school now.Meh- The notch is a bit strange or not impressively useful but not a deal breaker. Didn't notice it was there for a while- iOS is iOS. If you're not a fan of the operating system, this phone isn't going to convert you.Cons- Expensive! Not the best value phone by a mile, but I'm invested in the Apple ecosystem now",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Using my iPhone X for several months now and I’m loving it. The screen quality is very crisp and sharp, the overall size of the phone is handy and comfortable to use compared to the size of iPhone Plus models. The camera quality is a great step up from the older iPhone models and I must say it is very comparable to a entry level DSLR cameras.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"5.8 inch screen bigger than the Plus version, but because it is a full version of the design, so the real machine is relatively small, and it is much smaller, can hand operation, the following comparison chart for readers reference is attached. But no physical Home button after operation are all changing gestures, originally I want to say should become very complex and not too comfortable, but after a few times with down, have to say is very good to fit in and better than before",Productreview.com.au

It takes stunning pictures in low light and portrait mode.The phone is a good size and weight, it is beautiful and sleek.I did miss having a home button but have forgotten all about it!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Let me remember iPhone 5. iPhone X has whole screen on the front face. The size of screen is equal to iPhone 7 plus. But, in fact, during my using, the screen is just like iPhone 7 or 8. The top and bottom of screen is just wasted when u play game. And it does not suit for people who has big hands. But I have to say the design is beautiful. And don't forget, do not buy any iPhones less than 128gb, or ur everyday job is delete, delete and delete.Overall, I return to my iPhone 7 plus. And I'm waiting for the next generation.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I get why people think it's too small, but coming from a samsung galaxy, I like that it fits in my pocket. I do find the screen is a bit too fragile as the edges go further out but the screen is prettier. I like the face id better than the fingerprint ID but it is a bit iffy when I wake up. I wouldn't say it's better or worse than previous iphones, it's just smaller and has a better battery life.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Generally iphone X is excellent. But sometimes when I watching movie and charging at the same time, phone will become too hot. Really worry if battery life will reduce if this things happen. Without home button is pretty cool anyway. In fact after I changing Iphone X , realize home button is really useless.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The face id is a little bit not as convenient as fingerprint ID but it is cool and high-tech. So I really like the feeling when unlocking it with just simply looking at it. The screen is more narrow than my previous iphone 6 plus so a little bit not happy. Apart from above all this, the phone is nice to use and always fast.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Amazing user experience! I do like the new all-screen display (not such all screen as there is a notch). The touch screen is very responsive and the new OLED screen looks amazing. Better than any other iPhone available on the market. Face ID could be improved a bit with speed, but overall it is very fast. I upgraded from an iPhone 6 and noticed a very big difference.The only issue with this is that the iPhone X sometimes gets really, really laggy.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Forgot the people who say that Apple users are all about show and hype. This product is amazing and worth every penny.The camera is better than a DSLR, the phone is lightning fast and no home button means things are just better and more efficient. You will get used to it in no time. Great size phone, fits in the hand perfectly.Would say go buy one as soon as you can, its the best phone in the history of mankind",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"After using it for 2 months, I am disappointed in the sense that as someone mentioned, not all apps supports the full screen. In fact, for apps that does not support the full screen, the screen size displayed ends up being smaller than iPhone 8+. Now, don't get me wrong, the phone itself is fast with no lag. In fact, all Apple Phones on release has no lag. After a few years, when the apps start demanding more power, then the lag will appear.I also hate the fact that there is that darn home line below the screen. Maybe I am dumb, but not being able to disable it has affected my game player as it is annoyingly there.In the end, I seriously thinks that iPhone 8+ would have been a better choice for me.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,iPhone X is the greatest iPhone that Apple has ever made. The gesture control is leading for another 5 years at least. Cannot really go back to any phones with home buttons even those old iPhones. Android devices got into trouble this time with this beast. definitely will buy next iPhone.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,it is fast...but apparently the camera doesn’t always work well... at least I can say my mom’s Huawei camera is better than my X...and one more thing...I still miss home button and I don’t know why they don’t use this button any more...one thing that makes me happy is the face recognition system,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I can’t say how pleased I am with the X. All the negative press was absolute rubbish. It works a treat! No issues and the battery life compared to earlier models is brilliant! Facial recognition software rarely fails. I do miss the home button but easily adjusted to life without it. The speakers are crystal clear. Only thing that could possibly tarnish it is the lack of a headphone jack. Now you need to use the charge port for headphones, meaning no charge and jam :/",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"If you are in the Apple system, then you normally get the latest iPhone every year or every two years. IPhone X being the latest and most exciting iPhone, has significant new features that many find exciting about, including Face ID, which only comes in iPhone X currently, and is indeed time-saving and easy-to-use in most cases. It, however,  becomes less desired than Touch ID when using Apple Pay as when putting your iPhone X close enough for an efpos machine to read, you have to somehow make your face close enough for your phone to recognise you. The full screen can been seen on many other phones released recently as well but iPhone X gives you the best screen ratio and thus the small form factor, very preferable for some. Better cameras front and rear and faster cpu and gpu than almost all other phones on the market. Whether that justifies the price tag is up to individuals. If you like bigger screens, wait for the next gen iPhones.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"A great phone but at it's price point, honestly expected more. Feels like it's production was rushed and a unfinished buggy product was released to generate media attention. The facial recognition at times is quite buggy and to be honest the whole Animoji gimmick get's old fast. However like all other iPhones, it does run exceptionally well.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The screen is the first thing you notice, it is just beautiful with the edge to edge design. The camera is the best I've ever used and the touch screen is responsive and there is no lag whatsoever. It is an expensive investment but I expect to get at least 3 years out of it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,This phone is very impressive - as you would expect for their flagship model. The face ID is a great change and very useful compared to touch ID. The photo quality is great and the screen size is a nice intermediate between the traditional iphone and iphone plus models. The OLED screen makes everything look very crisp and the glass back makes it feel very sleek. I love my iphone x!,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I switched back to Apple from my Samsung S6 mainly due to the IOS as it works better with my other macbook and ipad. Loving this phone so far, battery lasts all day, I find myself with just under 50% battery at the end of the day, so I charge it at night while I sleep. Face recognition does it job but I have one minor issue is that for the face recognition to see you you need to be looking at the phone from the correct angle, often I have my phone laying flat on a desk and wish to open it from there but end up having to pick up the phone for it to read my face. Camera is great though when on portrait mode getting the bokkeh effect with the blurred background sometimes it blurs to much of the subject, that may just be me being picky. Overall though loving it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Overall this is a great phone. Integration of the software and powerful hardware make it zippy fast, sensitive to touch and responsive to use. It has a great 5.8 inch screen that goes mostly edge of edge of visible screen (not exacty to the edge though). It feel luxurious. And it works.New features such as face recognition and emojis are a plus. The loss of fingerprint security is annoying. The camera is one of the better ones out there - i loved the quality. It takes a little while to relearn the gestures though.However it is quite expensive. I do not exactly think it quite justifies the extra $500 AUD cost over the iphone 8 but if you are willing to pay premium, why not! IOS is still my favourite.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The screen, especially the colour reproduction is stunning. The front and back cameras are simply the best mobile camera I've ever used. System is silkily smooth thanks to the A11 chips. The bezeless design provides well-balanced size and weight. The top notch is a failure to me though since it doesn't fit the whole design and jeopardise some app's display. Price is acceptable when comparing to the 256GB model.Overall satisfied with it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Used: Three to four months.Pros: Build quality, design, display colour accuracy, Apple Store service, camera.Cons: Face ID is not perfect, screen known to be scratch prone.I did not list price as a con. I honestly feel the phone is worth it based on its design, build quality and for what I use it for. If you’re concerned about it’s price and care little for design and Face ID and still want an iPhone, the 8 is the better buy.Face ID works well, however it will not work with my sunglasses and your face must be at a similar angle each time. It’s much better than face unlock on competing models, but can certainly be improved on future models. Regardless, it’s still very convenient and I prefer it to Touch ID.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The Iphone X is quite easy to use, though it takes a while to get used to having no home button. The camera quality is improved a lot however other features are similar to the other series. It is quite expensive for something that is not too different to other iphones. You could probably get the same camera quality from Samsung for a more reasonable price",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"I  have waited months to replace my iPhone for this phone, only to find that without a screen protector within one day of putting in my pocket and looking after it very carefully the screen scratched easily and badly.  Shame on Apple for knowingly selling it like this with no gorilla glass and forcing you to buy the apple plan In order to have it replaced with another fee on top. Samsungs screen does not scratch so easily. Still getting used to the rest of the phone",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,This is the best iPhone by far. The screen is just beautiful with great colour reproduction. The screen is bezeless so it is big without having to have a big device. This is good because it makes it the perfect size for holding with one hand.Can’t fault the software as it runs super smooth. The camera is one of the best. Takes sharp pictures and has great colours.,Productreview.com.au

iphone,4,"For the most part, Face ID works, however it is isn't always accurate. I would say it's strike rate is about 8/10.

I wouldn't recommend this phone unless you have money to burn.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This is my first Apple phone after being a solid Android fan for years, and I am blown away. It’s fast, responsive, and takes amazing photos. I was scared that it would be too fragile, but It has already survived a drop without any issues.

The screen quality is AMAZING (super HD), phone size is perfect (I can't use the tiny 5 anymore), camera is unbelievably clear, and the phone is built very sturdy. The battery life can easily extend to 1.5 days of heavy use, the no home  button is easily adaptable, and the touch screen is very responsive. I have taken the phone travelling all over Europe (in freezing temperatures) with no issue at all.I only docked one star due to the hefty price (~$1,800 AUD) and the fact that I cannot listen to music and charge my phone at the same time (due to the no headphone jack). Apart from that its a really nice phone, hard to damage and definitely no regrets!",Productreview.com.au

I have used this for some time now, and I quite enjoy it.The Pros- face ID- new gestures- screen almost goes edge to edge (makes it more modern looking)- battery life lasted longer compared to my Iphone 7 Plus- easier to hold to take selfies- good front camera, and can use portrait mode for selfies too!The Cons- EXPENSIVE!- they don't have 128 GB model, which is done intentionally to force us Apple users to get the model above- Face ID does not work when you first wake up in the morning... happened a few times with me, and had to put in passcode to unlock it.- EXPESNIVE. Did I mention this already?If it wasn't some cashback I got with my credit card, I would not have purchased this phone because of the  RRP.

I definitely enjoy using it over the past couple of months.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The iPhone X is the best phone I've ever used or owned! I must admit that when I first heard that Apple were dropping the finger print scanner out for the Face ID, I almost didn't buy it. I had become so accustom to how easy the finger print unlock was that I assumed that Face ID wouldn't be as easy or as good, but boy was I wrong. It's a million times better, I can pull the phone out of my pocket and glance at it as I'm pulling it out and it's unlocked! I'm not kidding, it's that good! I was 100% surprised with how good Face ID works. It also makes using your phone so much faster, as when you go to a website with a login that's saved on your phone it automatically kicks the Face ID in and fills out the password so all you need to do it hit login, rather than move you finger down to the scanner, wait for it to work, then move your finer back up to hit the login button. This also works the same in apps!The camera on this thing is ridicules, the quality of the photos that come off of this phone are as good and any camera under $1000, I'm a very, very amateur photographer with a DSLR and I can put these photos up against it any day. Obviously you don't have all the zoom and long exposures and other features that a DSLR has but as a standard camera is amazing. Where it really shines though is with portrait mode, I taken so many amazing photos of my toddler with this phone that I wouldn't have ever had if I had to get out my DSLR as the moment would have gone by the time I got there.All the other things Apple had to change due to the fact it doesn't have a home button anymore, have been done perfectly by Apple, it so intuitive to use that after only a week of owning it I almost forgot how to use my old phone and was trying to control it with the new swipe gestures. The only thing that I seen to struggle with this the screen capture, once out of every 20 times I try to use it I accidently close the phone.Everything else works basically the same as any other iPhone only faster. I've not had any issues with the battery as I get more than a day out of it always, so no complaints there.I would recommend this phone to anyone in need of a new phone, you wont regret it!",Productreview.com.au

iphone,4,"Obviously being the newest iPhone, it has all the newest features. It's faster, has an incredible camera, has wireless charging etc. This does come at a cost though. It loses TouchID, which to me is actually really important and also is much much heavier. It's more slippery than my previous iPhone 7 and also requires you to take care of it more, incase of breaks. I'm also not a fan of the chrome edges, but that's a personal thing. The biggest killer is the cost. Yes it is the best iPhone, but that's if you're willing the spend the money.

It is more one hand manageable, but I miss the wider display. Face ID is good but wish it had both face ID and touch ID. Face ID can be a bit slow and doesn't work with sunglasses etc. Some of the gestures could be improved (accessing the quick launch menu from top right) could be better implemented but this is just a software update.

iphone,4,Love the way it unlocks the phone make life so much easier .but some of the old app on which I used to use on iPhone 7 not compatable with iPhone X . May be will fix with the update .but overalll the performance wise it’s pretty good phone.Cheers,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The phrase best iPhone yet seems to be something that is said at every announcement of a new iPhone by Apple executives. More often then not it’s true, in the case of the iPhone X (ten) it’s true, with some caveats.The design of the phone is flawless but so is the design of recent Samsung Galaxy phones, the screen is OLED (finally) and the speakers are best in class, they are loud, there’s a forward facing speaker (a rarity in mobile phones) and they don’t distort too much a loud volumes.The iPhone is C is fast, really fast but so was my iPhone 7, sometimes you never realise how slow your phone is until you are a generation or two behind and you use your friends new phone and apps just spring open instantly. The camera works great and Face ID is something you get used to really quickly, it works 8-9 our of every 10 times, but the issue here is you really notice those 1 or 2 times Face ID fails you, and I think that is because the process of Face ID is so seamless you don’t even know it’s happening until it fails you.As for the missing home button, that is something I actually grew to like, gesture become second nature, although having to tap and hold on an app in the multitasking menu before swiping up to exit it is more then a little annoying.But the biggest issue with the new iPhone X is while it is a whole new take on iPhone with a new design and screen, it’s still just an iPhone. I’m not sure what it is but maybe expectations have just been set impossibly high.Overall if you like bigger screens and that is a deal breaker, go for an iPhone 8 Plus or Samsung Galaxy, otherwise the iPhone X really is the best iPhone yet, but did anyone really think the newest iPhone wouldn’t be?P.S: I forgot to mention anything about the notch because I actually forgot about it, I guess that’s a testament to the design of the iPhone X.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"This phone has been impressive, as you would expect from a Apple product.However the leap from generation to generation has been getting smaller and smaller, I’ve owner every iPhone from the original one and while in the past I would rush out to get the latest model I feel I would have been better served keeping my iPhone 7Plus or getting a iPhone 8 Plus like my wife did.The battery is only okay at best and the lack of a fingerprint sensor is really missed when you are laying on your side at night (the face detection gets a little freaked out).If this phone was under $1000 I’d call it a great phone no questions asked but asking $1600 for it is just pure greed.Save yourself the money and buy a iPhone 8 Plus. It has all the features of the iPhone X for hundreds less..",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"There are high expectations for an Apple product and once again they have delivered. New face-id security and OLED screen was highly anticipated. To be truthfully honest, the Face ID can be annoying at first since your phone screen can be constantly on. Some problems encountered include overheating which was disappointing. The price can be steep and recommended to purchase via a plan.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Waited for so long for apple to make a full screen phone and I have finally gotten my wishe. Great phone, excellent size to fit in one hand yet the screen is bigger than any other apple phone. I never liked the plus models because I needed two hands to use them and this phone solves that problem. The colours on the screen are vibrant and the camera is something else! You get photos close to the quality of photos taken by some DSLR cameras. A bit pricy but worth every dollar.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The price was quite steep, however going from an iPhone 5s that dead after 2 hours of use the iPhone X was great lasting me 2 days per full charge. The face ID astounded me as the device scanned your face only 2 times, at the beginning the Face ID occasionally didn't recognise my face when lying down however, after a week or two it was a breeze and recognised my face always. The face ID makes it seem like there is no lock to you but there is to others. Don't regret my purchase at all!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The only failure is the facial recognition. Try having glasses on and off, it'll get highly confused and will not have a good ""hit"" rate of opening. The annoying thing as well is if you carry your phone and it sees your face and recognises it it will unlock even if the phone is at a distance next to your jeans pocket. So be aware that it could dummy dial. It does what it says otherwise.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"pros- quick processing. clear photos and videos. Apple's usual easy to use ecosystem.It was actually really easy to transfer data from the old phone to the new one.Cons - the facial recognition can be annoying at times. for instance when you;re wearing sunglasses, you may have to take it off to unlock your phone. Which is slower than the old finger print system. Certain angles are not recognised either. And when you first wake up in the morning, it doesn't unlock when you're squinting at your phone, not completely ready to open your eyes wide.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The Apple iPhone X features a stunning OLED screen with vibrant colours and deep blacks. The new Face-ID security feature works well most of the time, but fails often in challenging environments (like if you’re unlocking your phone with a drinking straw in your mouth). The little notch at the top was annoying at first, but I grew to love it as I saw how developers were cleverly integrating it. The speakers are fantastic, and the camera quality tempts me to leave my DSLR at home (though it’s not quite there yet). The build quality is stunning, however, the all glass design makes it extremely fragile. Purchasing Apple Care or other insurance is a must. Wireless charging and quick charging are both excellent features, however both require additional expensive cables and units.The Apple iPhone X is one of the best Smartphones I’ve ever used, however the high price makes it a very tough sell when you can get a comparable phone for about $500 cheaper.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"It took alot quicker than i thought to get used to face id. Overall - it is a good phone, abit pricey. Also it can be abit hard to use apple pay with face id cos you'll need to stare at the screen before paying while with touch id you can just scan your fingerprint while taking you phone out",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Absolutely amazing.Yes Samsung has these features years ago, yes Samsung has this screen years ago, yes Samsung this Samsung that but having everything is not so important, having everything together at the right time and in a product which is much superior to even hold is as important as it can get.Big icons, absolutely amazing camera and video quality.Love the AR FEATURE WITH GAMES ETC.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Being an early adopter I rushed out to get the latest phone. Now having used it over the past few months I can confirm that while it's still the best phone money can buy, it's not entirely worth the exorbitant list price.The gorgeous OLED screen is absolutely a game changer. The rear telephoto camera significantly improves over  the 8 Plus particularly in low light. The front camera is sufficient and Face ID is interesting but not essential. The lack of a home button mean major changes in how you navigate.The Notch is still the all round weirdest product design choice and sure to be discussed in UX conferences as a rare misstep for apple.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Due to being the ecosystem of Apple and I have to keep using iPhone. This is the first phone I own has a high-resolution screen. I've been using my iPhone 6 and I feel like wow, a big upgrade for me. My partner also own one and really happy with it",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"There’s no reason to hate on a newly released phone that is the same price as buying it directly from Apple. I think these phones are awesome. Of course, I don’t have the money or an issue with my current phone, so I can’t buy it now, but rest assured I would.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Bought this from Apple Official website.  The only problem is that the price is quite high.  The face ID is very easy to use. I bought the apple care+ together since I am a little worried about the OLED screen repair fee. I heard that the OLED screen can be burned if you use very often. So far I love this product.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I have been using this phone for the past few months and it's been great. The phone has a OLED screen with great colours. Face ID is really innovative and nice to use. The glass back is very fragile so a cover is a must. The camera takes nice photos.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"While the iPhone X is amazing and is a really innovative device from Apple, for a phone that costs almost $1600 it doesn't really outperform other flagship phones. At least not enough to make it worth it. Face ID is great but having to swipe up every time to unlock the phone is a bit cumbersome, especially if you're used to unlocking phones with fingerprint sensors. iOS in general is just a bit bloated and tedious coming from an Android phone, and animojis is quite gimmicky. Other than that, the phone is fast, great size and feel in the hand, amazing camera and decent battery life.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Best mobile phone you can buy, Face ID is two years ahead of what Samsung offers (Samsung is still in 2D face detect where a picture of your face can already bypass the security).Its feels good on hand, the latest Apple chips feel very fast, no more home button, water proof, improved camera all pack into the Glass & stainless steel design.  It is a expensive phone and it feels like one.Highly recommended if you can afford.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This is a beautiful phone, has great functionality. I did go from android to apple and I have to say, everything seems a lot smoother. There's a lot more uniformity with iPhones. It also looks great with the screen going to the edge, very sleek and modern. 64GB is absolutely enough for photos, apps (e.g. Spotify, facebook, messenger etc.)",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Honestly wasn't expecting anything to groundbreaking with this device but once you hold it in your hand you understand how great it really is. The full screen display is beautiful and the colour is very true. I couldn't go back to having a home button anymore. Apple have done it again.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I liked the notch. I embraced the notch. I thought it was top-notch design.But reading about how the apps are unoptimised and just a bit of a mess in general I am bummed. I’ll be going from a Plus size model to something that most of the time looks like a small Nexus 5X. For the time being anyway. Should’ve skipped this generation, really. But the hype was too strong. Love to see when holding it on my hand the design looks so beautiful, but apple needs to stepup the game and do more changes and perfomance optimizations with the iOS",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Honestly the best phone I've received so far. It's fast and easy to use. The use of no touch button was easy as apple has always been very good with user interface. No plans on going back to Android and it always seems seamless to use. 256 was a great bump,Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,I’ll be honest the battery life is just shocking and I don’t think the camera is to crash hot either. I had a Samsung galaxy note 8 and I found it a much much better phone. The screen was clearer and the photos were sharper. I like how it looks and feels in your hand but I should’ve stuck with Samsung.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"This phone is an excelent daily driver all the major tech under one roof. Photos are really clear, video has accurate colour. Battery life is 24hrs of moderate use at about 60% brightness which is good for outdoir viewing.. I would reccomend this phone to any apple lover out there.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,2,"I have moved from the 7+ and gone to the IphoneX and I do not like it at all!The facial recognition never works, you then have to wait for the passcode to pop up very frustrating!Has a greeat camera but so does the iphone 8+ for a way better price! overall would not recoment at all especially if you are going from the larger phone to the X/.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"This phone is slim and amazing and the style is sleek and works so smoothly and fast, the looks the style the speed this phone has everything, a definate buy! A little pricy but worth it for sure, i would recommend buying yourself one of the apple iphone X's .",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"I'd been waiting for the iPhone X for 2 years. My review follows this rant.2 years ago rumours started to circulate about this upcoming edge-to-edge fully glassed piece of art, which would be released on the iPhone's 10th anniversary. It would encompass the fastest processor, a 4k camera, 4k AMOLED screen, reality augmentation, new speakers, Face ID, In-screen Touch ID, and proximity wireless charging (a charging station that transmits a charge without contact).If the rumours held true this device would be the king of all Smart phones, no question.Over time, the hype was diminished by the release of Samsung and Google phones, which contained a lot of the above, but Apple still had an advantage; FaceID, In-screen Touch-ID and proximity charging. But as the release drew near, the rumours began to remain just that, rumours. Proximity charging was no longer on the list, the In-screen TouchID proved to be a nightmare for their Engineers so was pulled, the screen would be OLED @ 2k, and not quite edge to edge, in-fact, they'd introduce a weird notch to house the front facing camera and FaceID scanner along the top. 4 major technological downgrades.I've been an iPhone user since gen 3 and when September 2017 rolled around, a month prior to the X's release, I was, for the first time, contemplating switching to Samsung. But my history with Samsung's non-mobile electronics has been fraught with mental anguish; Washing Machine, TV and Fridge all broke down within 2 years (average - see my TV review), just trash; this coupled with my social circle advising that I stick with Apple are the reasons I did.REVIEW:I'd pre-ordered as soon as the online counter hit zero and was the first of anyone I know to receive the iPhone X and Apple Watch 3. Literally a couple of days after the official launch date. It was an exciting day. But like all shiny new toys, you're blinded by its shininess, so let's fast forward 3 months, which is how long I've owned an iPhone X for.PROS:Looks - It is a lot better looking than expected. A bit of old school roundedness mixed in with new school lines.Gestures without home button - The thoughtful gestures make navigation seamless and pleasant. It has improved dramatically.Screen - Great size. Crisp and beautiful colours. Even though the FaceID/Camera dash drops like 5-6mm from the top of the screen, surprisingly, it is virtually unnoticeable during general use.2 x Cameras (wide and telephoto) - Wow, every photo and video recorded is insanely detailed. The video resolution is mental and the built-in steadyshot tech makes shooting videos without shake, easy.Portrait Mode - Blurry backgrounds, Studio lighting and black backgrounds. Photos including selfies contain an enormous amount of detail and are simply stunning, like, DSLR stunning (I used to shoot with a Canon 60D DSLR). Once you get used to using these modes, the results truly are mind blowing. You can also change the portrait mode after the photo has been taken. I wonder if they plan on building these functions into Video?Glass - Like liquid. The upgraded glass is flawless.Augmented Reality - Funny, and precise but I don't use it much.Processor - Faster than ever!! Opening, closing and operating apps, multi-tasking between, all virtually instant! It is super fast.Speakers - Definitely a huge step up as far as phone speakers are concerned. There's also bass! And I'm a massive basshead, so it's astonishing how good the speaker quality has improved. Oh, and the volume seems to be 30-40% louder than the older models, imo.3D Touch - Always useful but not so much now with all the new touch gestures. I hope Apple don't render it redundant as I still use it, and they have a habit of removing useful features.Battery - Surprisingly good, my phone lasts a day and a half on average use. Don't get me wrong, I can still kill it in a day, but that's with heavy video use. It's been off the charger for over 9 hours and it still has around 80% life in it.Screenshot - Current IOS makes screenshots more useful, i.e. crop, share, disregard without saving to photos, draw...etc. Use this almost daily.FaceID - Although it's more annoying than good, I do appreciate that it recognises me with or without glasses/sunglasses/hats, even a wig and facepaint (Halloween party).CONS:Lock button - With the removal of the home button, they've loaded up the functions into the lock button, maybe too many? Tap and hold for Siri; I inadvertently activate her all the time. Double tap to activate ApplePay; if I don't accidentally activate Siri, I activate ApplePay instead. Lock+Up volume to access 'Power to Slide' or 'Emergency' settings; I've managed to accidentally set off an alarm I didn't know I had, and call emergency services. Up, then Down, then Lock to 'hard reset'? Down+Lock for Screenshot, this is good, and of course, simply just lock and unlock.It is a very busy little button!In addition, I only use Siri with 'Hey Siri' so I don't know why they don't have an option to deactivate Siri from the lock button.Touch to wake - This is just annoying. You'll instantly discover how sensitive the screen is. It can however, be turned off in the settings.FaceID - ""They say 60% of the time, it works everytime"" comes to mind. You quite literally have to be selfie ready everytime time you want to unlock it, buy something or open a secure app. It was funny and interesting at first, but now, it's just tiresome. It fails around 40% of the time, where TouchID failed maybe 2%, normally after a swim? When FaceID fails, it gives you a second chance before requiring your PIN, which delays unlocking the phone by like 3 seconds, which is equally nothing and everything, especially when I wasn't experiencing this issue with TouchID.It also won't recognise you first thing in the morning, or from certain angles, like when you're lying on your side or back. I'm a fit guy so I can't imagine gravity warping my face to the point it's unrecognisable?Weight - It is quite a heavy phone due to the upgraded aluminium body. I dread the day I eventually drop it on my face while using it in bed.Body finish - Thought it would be smoother. Has a slight edge between the glass and stainless steel.What's not in the box - I was hoping to get Airpods, and/or a Wireless Charging pad, and/or a fast charging adapter. Nope, nope, and nopity nope. You have to buy all of this stuff separately. Not happening.Well, that's it!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This is by far my most favorite phone ever, the size is so perfect, has all the visible screen size of a plus but being smaller it makes it easy for a small handed person to hold. The camera is to die for it's totally brilliant, love not having a home button, it's so responsive, love the ease of the face recognition, easy to pair all bluetooth devises, love the wireless charging options, happy that I can walk in the rain & not totally stress if it gets damp!! this phone is truly my new besty!!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Got it as a Christmas gift. It’s got Great features. Facial recognition Good size. I like that it is full screen, the camera is 4K which is amazing and the sound is better than any iPhone, I also like the fact that it is big. The graphics are out of this world.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I’ve had this phone for just over a month now.  It took a bit of getting used to the swiping up.  But now I forget and try and swipe on my iPad Air.The larger screen is for me Great.  Loving the upgraded camera as well it takes brilliant photos.  One of the reasons I’ve purchased it means I won’t need a seperate camera when away overseas later this year.I’ve recently been in hospital and had to use the ear phones.  The microphone on them was just excellent.It does use its battery a bit quicker than the 6s that I’ve upgraded from. But still not terrible.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I only update my iPhones every 3-4 years and ummed and ahhed between the 8 and the 10.I didn’t want the 8plus to achieve the good camera as it’s size, I feel, would be problematic.I read many reviews on line and did my diligent research, and although it was difficult to justify the price of the X I’m happy that’s the choice I made.The camera is amazing, the portait mode is professional and I love that you can edit within that after you’ve taken the portrait.And not that I plan on using my iPhone underwater, but the fact that it’s waterproof is peace of mind for those accidents in the bathroom!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I believe apple had done a fantastic job with the iPhone X release. The revolutionary Face ID feature has put a noticeable dent in the smart phone industry and I believe is the more well thought out technology on any smart phone too date. I must admit, when purchasing the device I didn’t think it would be this great but it definitely proved me wrong!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"A bunch of things you can like, it’s usual Apple product, easy to use. Something I don’t like is the size, it’s too small compared to previous iPhones owned. It was great camera, screen and is also waterproof! Apple is Apple! They’ve done it again! Recommended product in my opinion, go get one!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Upgraded from the 6 Plus, which I was already a hide fan of, with this purchase. This phone is smaller but has a similar size screen which I found more than satisfactory. Took some getting used to not having a home button but I found the face recognition for unlocking quick and efficient. Takes very good photos.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The concept of a full screen iPhone made it so appealing. It's pretty much a regular size iPhone with a near-Plus size screen. When I first opened the box and picked up the phone, I immediately noticed the heaviness of the device. Quite surprising especially for its size. It took me around a week to get familiar with the usability of the device with the non-home button, and the swiping functions.The battery life is very mediocre. If anything I feel the battery is a big negative. It would only last one whole day. I had high expectations that it would last at least a day and a half. My previous phone was the iPhone 7 Plus and I felt the battery life was much better.The full screen is pretty good except for when you watch full screen, you will have the a little obstruction that takes probably 5% of the screen away. This obstruction is caused by the earpiece and front camera. Watching a movie or a show is not much of an issue but it's a little awkward having an obstruction on the screen.The face recognition function is great but it can be annoying at times. The great part of it is being able to unlock it just by lifting up the phone and looking directly at it. The annoying part is that there will be times where it will not recognise your face and you'll be prompted to enter your pin. Another annoying part is when I have my phone on the table I can't use my finger print to unlock. I would have to either use the pin or pick up the phone to my face.Besides the non-home button, there's actually not much of a difference between the X and the predecessor. For the price, I would probably recommend waiting for the next iPhone 2018 where Apple will most likely make the phone much more lighter in weight, increase the battery life, and have quick-charging ability.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Love the face recognition. Amazing how well everything works and how many things I can do with it. Best phone camera I've ever seen. The battery life is the best yet. The screen is the clearest and cleanest I've ever had. I couldn't recommend this phone more highly. Expensive but worth the cost. Looking forward to what comes next,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,Lots of things to love about this phone - all the usual apple gear and ease of use. Things not to love - the size. I came from a 6plus and the screen was bigger - the X is similar length but not as wide. Don’t love that - it makes the keyboard squishy. I miss the headphone jack. I like the facial recognition but hate that I have to pick the phone up to open it. I wish there was a fingerprint option as well.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"This is without a doubt the most powerful and advanced mobile phone in this day and age. With a top of the range processor, camera, screen, memory, waterproofing; it is unbeatable. However, changes to the hardware and software such as the removal of the headphone jack as well as the home button, usage of the phone takes some time getting used to - and for some, they may never get used to it. If you think this is a problem, I would suggest going for the iPhone 8 line at a much lower price point.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"So much faster than iPhone 7, battery will last two days if I don’t go into areas with no phone reception.Facial recognition that I thought would be a gimmick is so good, so much better than the finger print system.Siri seems to work better than it did on the 7, I can make numerous calls in the truck and not touch the phone!!.I am so pleased I changed and spent the money, well spent for sure.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Face ID junk featureNever turn on with Face ID in the night or very close to your phone.And Eyes need to be fully open.And in the middle of the night, no one wants to open full eyes.Pretty junk feature.Touch ID is a more convenient feature.Thanks",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Great design and fast, face ID works well, love the face ID it works well. nicely fit into the hand with a great screen size. charging is fast and the battery last really well.

iphone,5,"Been using my Iphone X for about 4mths now. The phone runs fast and the screen is so big, All apps and games run without a problem. The phone is just wow loving it all, When taking pictures you can pick for so many option and the picture comes out so good. I would buy it again",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The fact that it is based on face recognition makes it very easy for me to work with, although it would take time for some companies to adopt their applications with this new feature.A side from this the big screen is very good for reading stuff in the web and the whole thing is useful.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I bought the iPhone X 2 months ago and it’s extremely fast, always recognises my Face ID, never glitches or crashes and is it easy and simple to use. I would definitely recommend buying this product as it’s size is very nice and easy to hold. All programs run fast and easy.Best way I’ve spent my money.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This phone is very handy, it has every feature I need to run business away from the office. It is light, and slim and I found it very easy to use. the phone itself is not very different from the last model however its just great that Apple continue their great service in providing a reliable product",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"One of the best phone that I have used in the last 10 years. Great battery life and the face recognition works flawlessly even in pitch dark. Bit pricy but it worth it, considering you are not upgrading every year.Just put a good case for protection, which these days Is a must on their phones.Optus delivered in 2 weeks with free sports subscription.Very happy with the product and its features.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"When you spend $1600 on a new phone you want it to be impressive.  The iPhone X is mostly impressive particularly with battery life, speed and apps.  My former Samsung Galaxy 6 still has an edge in some interactivity and intuitiveness but the battery was struggling to last a day.  The iPhone screen is probably better than the Samsung galaxy 6 and its is slightly smaller, but the difference is not really significant.  Overall happy with IPhone X so far.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"A bit of getting used to at first: no home button, full screen. But ""swipe up from the bottom"" is quickly as natural as ""click on the home button"". Face ID is great - it basically disappears into the background, so all you have to do is pick up your phone and it feels like it's always unlocked. It's fast, and the screen is georgeous. It's physically about the same size as the ""S"" model phones even though the screen is about the same size as a ""plus"". The camera is awesome. Only downside, I guess, is that it is expensive and with glass front and back you would not want to drop it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This phone is absolutely apples best phone yet. Take away the gimmicks of Animoji and selfies and this phone is powerful. The camera, the OS, the OLED screen. I’ve always been an Apple boy and always will be an Apple boy. This phone has set a standard for smartphones that no doubt others will soon follow.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,All in all it is a good phone. I don't think it is much different to the iphone 8 but it is a great phone. The screen is so large it is awesome for watching movies the graphics are good too. Battery life is not too good but thats to be expected with iphone.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,Going from the 7 plus to the X was hardBut I wanted the latest phone.I really struggled for the first week with all the gestures and consider swapping with my son how I had purchased the 8 but then I was like no dam 15 year old is getting this phone I will get out of my comfort zone and I now 5 weeks on love it !I have had glitches but they have been fixed with updates.Camera is AAA+++,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I bought iphoneX for my wife and she's loving it especially the face recognition. The screen is a bit small compare to iPhone 7 plus. However, the screen clarity is on top.This smart phone is quite expensive so If you're a big tight budget don't buy outright. Just go with deal phone service provider with zero interest.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"The Apple iPhone X would be an absolutely wonderful device, if it wasn't for that notch at the top. That notch is so annoying. Seriously. Face ID is great, and real innovation, a first in many years for this company. Also, the fact that the iPhone X doesn't come with a Face Charge adapter is absolutely mind-boggling, you pay a super premium price for this phone, but don't get peripherals that you phone is made to work with.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"While the ‘button’ from the bottom has been removed there is now a gap up the top which is quite annoying. It’s still easy enough to use, light and love the Face ID. Overall do feel this phone is ‘faster’ once you get used to it which was important for me",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This is definitely the best iPhone ever made, though whether its worth the asking price is questionable. The screen is absolutely beautiful (I hated the notch at first, but you quickly get used to it).But FaceID is the killer feature. It's fast, simple and secure enough to replace your fingerprint. It's almost like not having your phone locked. It makes the phone seem incredibly smart and it's something the competition will struggle to replicate for a while.The camera is also incredible, and portrait mode works pretty great for the most part - when it's perfect it takes photos that make people say ""how was this taken on a phone?""I'm really, really happy I bought this. It's the best iPhone yet.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This phone is nothing short of amazing! At first I was skeptical about the no home button and Face ID but I have come to love it! Swiping up to unlock and get out of apps feels so natural now, Face ID works flawlessly almost 100% of the time even when in bed and it’s dark, the screen is outstanding and both the cameras with portrait mode make the photos look like their from a professional camera, while sometimes the front camera will has trouble distinguishing between background and focusing on the subject, most off the time it’s great. Battery life could be better but is okay when using wireless charging throughout the day",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Have used iphone X for one month, so far so good.The screen looks very good, and also very fast. It is ok for non-square screen although I do not like it. In addition, it will be better if the screen becomes little bit bigger.Do not like the feature which does not have 3.5mm headphone jack, and have to use lightning for charging and headphone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,The iPhone X didn’t disappoint.It is everything a iPhone is and more.The face recognition was spot on and easier to use then the finger scan.There was some small connection problems initially and the iCloud did not download everything seamlessly which is very unlike Apple.All in all the IPhone is great and didn’t disappoint and a much much better mobile then Samsung or any of the other mobiles on the market.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,2,"For a company that has made a great phone in terms of functionality, camera, speed etc they have got it wrong in some very important areas such as durability and price.Durability  - Glass front and back - this phone is the most fragile iPhone yet. It cracked on the very first drop in all strength tests.Price - $1,600 AUD for a phone is outrageous. Technology should be going down in price, not up. This phone isn't revolutionary like the first iPhone was. It does nothing better than any Android device but charges a premium because of their brandReplacement costs - Over $800 if you damage your phone. I cracked mine whilst in a sturdy case just with gentle pressure.Battery - the battery life is good but already after 2 months, it started to diminish.This will be my last Apple purchase - I am sick of their arrogance, price and lack of ability to build a phone that can withstand daily use.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This is one of the most secure way to keep your stuff private .. in finger print scan your close ones could keep their finger prints as password but with this Face ID only you can unlock your iPhone. Other gestures are working perfectly, it seems hard to operate initially with out home button but with in couple of days I got used to with it and found it simpler.And what can I say about the display. Crispiest display. Loved the camera with portrait mode. I don’t need DSLR camera anymore.Overall I loved this version of iPhone and looking forward to see next one too..",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,The Apple iPhone X is the best Phone Apple has put out with a large screen and easy to use apps  .Unlike the previous Apple iPhones the screen is from top to bottom and the camera is better it has many more features you what be disappointed with this phone,Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,I upgraded from an iPhone 6s and to be honest I am a little underwhelmed with the iPhone X. The facial recognition is great and it does have a bigger and clearer screen however for the price I am not sure it is worth it. If I had known at the time about Apple's policy of slowing down older phones through software updates I would probably have just purchased a new battery for my 6S,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Just purchased the iPhone X after having the iPhone 6 Plus.  Just love the ease of use as I thought it would be difficult to adjust not having a home button on the bottom as I have been use to for the past several years.  Takes an awesome photo - apps are quick and easy to download.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"What can I say, I am a fan of Apple products especially their phones. I am aware that other brands are good competitors to this iPhoneX model and probably cheaper,  I wouldn't change mine for any other brand. Love the new features, the size is perfect , the responsiveness is fast, the capacity give you peace of mind and is ready very smart. So many good features but I am impressed with the improved Siri, who came back to the Xmodel smarter than ever.",Productreview.com.au

Far better than finger print technology. Love it,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I bought iPhone X yesterday from Office works at the very cool price (around $1600). It will be bit struggle for the iPhone users to get used to no home button. Also, the facial recognition for unlocking iPhone is a bit not worthy.It took me a little time to adjust to the changes like closing apps is different and the zoom in and out still annoys me but overall the battery lasts the larger screen is good and it is quick too to open and close browsing windows.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Never been this satisfied with a phone 3 months after buying it. I don't get sick of this thing!! I have it in Silver and the colour is so flashy and outstanding. The performance is amazing. The camera is out of this world, I don't even use my DSLR anymore. The face recognition is so convenient for all secure apps and having iCloud Keychain keeps all my devices linked to my accounts. Good job Apple!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I recently upgraded from an iPhone 6 plus to the X.The phone has a good battery life, possibly not as long as my iPhone 6 plus when new but with only light use I easily get 2 days use for a charge.The most controversial feature the face unlocking works well and gets better with time (it appears to learn).The LTE modem is amazingly fast, I regulary get 150mb+ speed test results.  Much faster than previous iPhones!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,So far so good. I haven’t had any dramas with the issues that have been put forth in the media. Camera is definitely better. The phone itself responds so much quicker to demands . Speaker is also better than my 6plus. I do like that the screen fills the whole front of the phone but it did take me a bit to get used to not having a home button.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Awesome product! Well worth the wait and line up. New features are great, can only see this brand growing and dominating the market.’I would never go to a Samsung!! Have showed all my friend and colleagues to much of their delight. I think I’ve drummed up some sales for Apple!!!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I've tried iPhone before and it's good, hardware is excellent and the service Apple offer is as good as it can get. iOS 11.xx is better than before and the gesture based OS is smooth to operate and has many advantages that is usually apparent when the manufacture also supplies the firmware.  The Apple Ecosystem is really good where other devices just dovetail and this phone is no exceptionPros:  Fast, great backup service, quality build (although the glass is nothing like the Samsung which feels more premium).  For a phone the size it is the display is crisp and clear, bright in strong sunlight, Audio quality is excellent and carriers support features like vOLTE ( HD calling in apple terms) and Wi Fi calling unlike some phones that could but are not supported (EG the LG V30).  Software is fluid.  Changing to a new iPhone is as easy as ever with your previous settings and apps easily restored.  Camera is great and Apple pay is fast.Face unlock is really good and very fastCons: Apple is the true Nanny state product, the controls over this system and phone are still as tight as ever, consequently customisation is limited to an overbearing degree,  Despite the price tag and the great build there's not much difference really between this and the last models, the operating system is old and boring which drags down the potential of a well designed phone.  Whilst this may suit many who like the simple and restrictive eco system for many the purchase of this phone not worthwhile as it's not really different to all the earlier models.The cost is absurdThe notch ... for some it's there larger than life and very annoying, software that hides the notch in wallpapers does not work in apps.  The only possible purpose is to make the screen measurement larger but Apple should allow customers to have this as a black area containing useful information where sensors allow instead of having a bite out of the top of the phone.  The notch is about as useful as an ashtray on a motorcycle/The headphone jack is disappointing but inevitable.  The lightning connector should have been replaced with a USB- Type C connector if Apple were serious about moving forward, there is really no excuse for this at all.Most of the issues relate to iOS holding back the potential of this phone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The camera is amazing.Getting used to no home button, which I thought was going to be hard. Was a non issue from the first swipe.The phone is a dream to use. The screen is beautiful, the brightness and colours never disappoint.Face ID is great.And the face tracking emojis are very cute .Overall 10/10. Best phone Apple has created to date. Best smartphone out there.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The phone is a nice evolution from previous models.  No huge changes or advancements.  the camera is great and the phones works well.  OS is responsive and battery life gets you a full day with heavy use.Dislikes - fewer colour options than previous models, only off white and black.  teh screen is also a bit smaller than my Iphone 6s Plus.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"This phone is lovely to use. A beautiful screen and great feel. The hardware is very responsive and capable. Admittedly it was a little annoying to use at first, as the lack of headphone jack was a bit awkward. however now that I have bluetooth headphones and a wireless charger, those annoyances have completely disappeared!Both cameras on the phone are great. The built in camera app on iOS11 is also much more capable of taking advantage of the cameras. It also charges quickly and battery lasts as long or better than I expected (Previously had a 6 Plus).There have been some dicey aspects to the launch of iOS 11, namely keyboard glitches, some podcast glitches, a few crashes, and it wouldn't be fair to not mention those, as this phone cannot run without iOS 11, so they are somewhat hand in hand. However these glitches have been quickly addressed by apple, and have certainly not been catastrophic.I recommend the phone, particularly if you want to be able to take quick, mindless and beautiful photos.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Apple can never go wrong on their technology, love the camera features especially the selfie one along with the speed and clarity on the screen, the face if feature is awesome  u.

iphone,3,"I ordered the iphone X a while ago, and it finally arrive about a month ago. Over the past five years I've been using both Android and iphones, usually one for work and the other for personal use so I'm very familiar with what each can do; but as I use both it also means I haven't moved my whole life over to the Apple ecosystem and can switch easily between the two.The iphone X is okay, the large screen is great, the camera is also great, but that's really it and considering the price I expected more. The facial recognition works a lot of the time, even sometimes when I'm wearing sunglasses, but it takes longer to get into the phone than when using the finger print scanner on my old iphone, so seems to be a bit of a gimmick! The software is pretty similar to my old iphone, couple of minor tweaks here and there, so nothing special. The phone runs very smoothly though, and is quicker than my old one (but that may be because Apple intentionally slowed the old one down, so really hard to gauge!!)Overall, it's an impressive phone, but I really don't think it's worth it. The iphone 7 range still seems pretty good to me, alternatively one of the many Android phones at a cheaper price.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Its the best gadget i can get. Cant get better than this. It have everything . Its beautifulin tearms of looks, have awonderful camera with various differnt functins, face id to unlock , the screen is so big, its too fast too. Has so many in built apps on which i can work",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"After almost two months of using Face ID, it's clear this is one of those innovations that's immediately both intuitive and invisible, and will eventually prove indispensable. It's at it's most convenient when you've got wet fingers, as that would usually result in many failed authentication attempts with Touch ID. However, it's at it's least convenient when wearing the darkest of sunglasses, as authentication fails more often than not (although it's fine with most sunglasses). While on the inconveniences, I've also found that touch-to-wake and raise-to-wake aren't worth the cost to battery life as the phone seems to keep waking while I'm walking around with it in my pocket. This was causing the battery to drain much faster than it should. In order to further optimise battery life I use Smart Invert to convert while backgrounds to black, as the OLED screen should be able to switch off any full-black pixels. Once enabled, triple-pressing the side button toggles it on and off so it's fast to disable it when you need to (it's only moderately ""smart"" so it still inverts the colours in most images).Coming from a 6 Plus, I much prefer the narrower, longer form factor of the X. It's a lot easier to use with one hand. The screen is also noticeably better, particularly viewing photos and videos. However, perhaps the most significant improvement is in the camera. While it struggles in low light, or zooming into long distance, in most situations it takes extremely good photos.Rather than bemoan the loss of the headphone jack, I've taken the opportunity to pair the iPhone X with BeatsX wireless earphones. Similar to the change from Touch ID to Face ID, now it's hard to imagine going back.Overall, the iPhone X is an amazing device. Given how much we rely on our smartphones, to me it's been well worth the investment.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Don’t listen to what the tech review site says, this new Apple iPhone X has completely redesign not only what the new standard of edge to edge display should be on a phone but also the new way users interact with their smart phones.Apple sets the standard when they introduce the home button for the first smartphone in the world, and now they are first to introduce no home button for smart phone user interface. The new flow is also so much quicker because we no longer tap on the screen to perform action we now also swipe and slide which means the swipe up to go home is a natural flow.Face ID is also how the fastest way to unlock the phone and performing and ID verification. These two features are what sets this phone apart from the rest of the competitor and no doubt will be the new standard moving forward.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"It is certainly overpriced, especially considering that there is not many essential accessories in the box.Also, sometimes apps freeze and one has to restart the phone.The 5 watt charger that is included is sure underwhelming.The included lightning Earbuds are terrible. I have been throu six at least within a year. It seems that apple intentionally want people to pay for their wireless AirPods!! Their so-called Genius Bar is all dismissive about it!The face recognition technology is fairly great though.I would not really recommend Apple products anymore.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The iPhone X definitely meets my expectations. It’s certainly a lot smaller than the 8 plus, but if you think about it the bezels are the size difference between the 8 plus and the X. Battery life is awesome, but it is my first day using it so I’ll see how it tapers off with use. Face ID works like a CHARM. Quick and easy. Very satisfied with Verizon’s network too, speedy and reliable. Overall I am one very happy satisfied customer!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Love it and try to ignore how much it cost.Purchased on vacation so sightless cheaper.After picking up old iPhone 6s the new screen feels worlds better on the new phone.While the new X is noticeably heavier than the 6s the new iPhone X feels more solid and looks super chic.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,So I have had my iPhone X for two months now and I love it.

iphone,4,"I just notice that sometimes the system froze. and i want to review the design of the physical phone. It is sometimes confusing which is top or bottom. Maybe i just used to the previous iphone style that there is a home button. Iphone x doesnt have home button but it screen design on top, the curve, for me is not good. I think it is better if the style of the top and bottom is the same. Just straight. I think they maximise the space.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I had the iPhone 3, 4, 5 and then 6. I decided that was smart enough for a smart phone and I didn’t need any new phone. Temptation got the better of me and now I have the new iPhone X. Frankly I have no regrets. The new Face ID feature works great and apparently more secure than finger ID. With the Home button missing, it does take a little getting used to, but no more than couple of days. You don’t need to read extensive product manual to make the most of the phone. Just search on YouTube for top 10 iPhone X feature, and you will know most of what you need to know. The battery life is great (I understand it has two batteries packed inside) and the camera is great too. It has one of the fastest processor of any smart phone on the market and the latest OLED screen is really good. Just be careful you don’t drop the phone and crack the screen as it can set you back about $500. Is it value for money? I am not so sure about that. I think it’s a bit too pricey for a smart phone and for that reason I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This is the first upgrade that really makes it worh your while. Face ID works flawlessly and the new OLED screen is amazing.The battery life has definitely improved as well.

iphone,4,I was really pleased that I held out for the Iphone X.  The camera is so much better and the photos look like they have been taken on a DSLR.  My only quibbles are the battery life and the price.  Hopefully the battery life will be improved with IOS updates.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"$1.8K for a phone?I could build a great computer, buy a laptop or go on a great trip with that kind of money. But your are not here for that reason.You want to know whether the phone is worth the money and my answer is No.It's a great phone! but here's the thing, it's not worth the money. You are essentially getting an iPhone 8 plus in a smaller form factor.It's slower to use as the FaceID is still new and it's a 3 step process to unlock you phone instead of the 1 step to unlock with TouchID.Closing apps is a big pain in the but as you have to wait a few seconds to bring up the tabs and the hold again for a few seconds to bring up the close app icon.At least you know you won't turn off you phone accidentally though! it requires 2 buttons :PScreen is nice but viewing angle is not great compared to LCDs.The camera is super great! I love it for both video and photo.The call quality is pretty rubbish, where people on the receiving end hear you like you are living under water. Your mouth actually has to be almost touching the microphone area. Hopefully Apple figures this issue out asap as that's the primary function of the device.P.S. FaceID works with sunnies and in the dark ;)I'd say wait until next year where Apple has covered some R&D costs on the new form factor and lower the price of the new gen iphone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"A great blend of handheld comfort and a big, gorgeous OLED screen. Rear telephoto camera outshoots the 8 Plus in low light, and the front camera snaps impressive portrait selfies. Face ID generally works fine. New interface and no home button mean major adjustments, and key features such as the Control Center are harder to reach and use. It’ll take time for most apps to be optimized for notched screen. The phone is hella expensive, and the all-glass design means a case and an insurance plan are musts.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"We own 2 of these (wife and I) and have owned Iphones from the very early days. ie: iphone 3 onwards. We didnt get the 6s or 7, instead moved from 6 & 6plus to two X's. I must say, this has definitely been their best so far. Like the saying goes, new brooms sweep well, although the new features and improvements over their previous models is remarkable. The face recognition is fantastic, so much quicker and gets even better with lots of apps adding the feature as time goes. Camera just blows everything out of the water. Even compares to my Nikon D5000 SLR, well almost ;). Always had friends hanging crap about their samsungs having a better camera, and yes they did, until the X came out. At least its now on par or even better in my opinion.One last thing, I hesitated quite a bit moving from a 6plus to this thinking I'll miss the size of screen. Not one bit, this screen is actually larger and the clarity so much better.",Productreview.com.au

iphone,5,"Love my new iPhone X. Was one of the lucky ones who got mine on pre-order, so no queuing up. Easy to setup and so much easier to use and intuitive compared to the 7 and 8 series models.

iphone,5,"Moving on from an iPhone 7, I already had a terrific phone and camera, but it's now gone to my other half. I waited a while for the new iPhone X (pronounced TEN) and I just love my new phone. I decided quite some time ago to travel without a camera, so was keen to move on to the dual lens iPhone X (but didn't want the extra size of a 7+ or 8+).I was initially slightly concerned about the lack of a home key or fingerprint scanner, but needn't have worried. The facial recognition is brilliant and almost instant, except very occasionally with too much back light. (It is certainly far more reliable than the fingerprint scanner. Of course you can still enter your PIN code if there is an issue.)A quick watch of a YouTube video taught me all I needed to know about the new gestures eg: accessing the control centre (diagonal wipe from the top right) - it is very easy to do everything without the home key, and I do not miss it AT ALL.For anyone struggling with it, watch a video and you won't miss the home button- good riddance to it.Some people don't like the ""notch"", (it's there for a reason -camera, face scanner etc) and I couldn't care less. Some people don't like change, if that were the case we'd all still be using the old Nokia Brick phones.The iPhone X is a bit different, but once you're used to it, you should love it, I do. You don't need a home button!(If you don't like change, buy an 8 or 8+, -but you'll be in the minority.)The phone works as it should, is super fast, the camera is brilliant, (LOVE the new portrait mode) I couldn't be happier with it whether photos or video. And if you're after a bit of fun there is always the  animojis which are very clever, (but of no real use!)",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I've only had it a couple of weeks but loving it so far! The oled screen is amazing resolution with crisp display. The face recognition has been working great although I do miss the home button  bit. Takes some getting used to doing a screenshot by pressing volume up and power button. But overall very happy with it. Price point is too high though and they should make it more affordable in future models.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The screen is really clear and it's easy to get used to the lack of the home button.  The Face Recognition ID is brilliant in placed of the fingerprint ID and it's a lot faster than the 6S it replaced.  However, the notch at the top of the screen is truly awful and you can no longer see the remaining battery percentage, without some mucking around.  Very expensive for what it is, especially for the small amount of storage it includes.  Overall it is ok, but not earth shatteringly good, needs work.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Great phone, was hard to get use to but it’s great once you do. The hey Siri function is brilliant. The only down fall is the screenshot function which was weird to get use as I randomly would take screenshots without my knowledge. The camera is fantastic too.

iphone,5,"I love this new iPhoneX big improvements from the older models ,it's much faster colours are brighter, camera is brilliant . It's a bit heavier than the older models but it just seems the perfect size .

It is very easy to adapt to from previous models, anything that you can't figure out immediately you can find instructions online.  The new photo features are great and allow you to take more interesting photographs. I love the size of the phone, being smaller than the plus versions yet have a larger screen.

iphone,3,"I purchased my iPhone X from Virgin mobile on a two year contract. I was looking forward to its arrival but was soon disappointed with this phone once I started to use it. The reason I have remained loyal to the Apple iPhone is because I enjoyed its easy and familiar interface since my first iPhone, the iPhone 4 but the iPhone X throws all the familiarities out the window. It’s like they changed things just for the sake of change and had a blatant disregard for the operators usability. The missing home button is painful and to do what was once simple has now become quite complicated, for example closing off apps on the iPhone X the user must slide up from the bottom of the screen, then hold their finger on the app and then close it off like they did with the ancient ios4 system. The reachability feature sucks and is far more complicated then the previous iPhones, the user must swipe from the bottom of the screen to lower the icons. I can only manage to get this right half the time and with the longer screen this feature is more important then ever. Then there is the screen quality, the screen has a yellow tint like it is stuck in permanent night mode. The facial recognition is temperamental and wastes time when it is working out if it is my face staring into the screen. They say the facial recognition lock is faster and more reliable then the fingerprint Touch ID but i found it to be the opposite. Especially because I like to hold my phone at waist height when I use it sitting down.There are some positives with the iPhone X, the battery life exceeded my expectations. The camera quality is great and the new full screen is nice but it’s not enough to keep me loyal. After years of loyalty this will probably be my last iPhone purchase ever.

iphone,5,"The newest iPhone model is exactly what I've always wanted. It's super fast, it's sleek and beautiful. The screen is on another level, and to top it off... Facial recognition (Face ID). Face ID is a huge part of the phone which works perfectly without you doing anything. You literally just look at your phone.The phone itself is a perfect size and the battery is the longest lasting of any previous iPhone I have had. This might have something to do with the new OLED screen, which is stunning.Without a home button, there are a few new things to get the hang of, but it will happen pretty quickly. This also makes it feel more like a new phone as it's not the same old thing as the predecessors. All in all, I recommend this iPhone as it's an exceptional device.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"What a beautiful phone! It's got glass on the back, so it is a bit heavy, but you get used to it after a while. The animated emoji function is really cute, neat and entertaining.

You won't regret purchasing this phone!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Best phone I have ever had. The home button may be gone but takes no time to adjust to the new ways and this is from a 53 year old. Face ID works really well even when wearing someone else’s glasses. The OLED screen is a cracker being vibrant and crystal clear. Some competitors may be brighter but then they start looking fake. Battery life is ok and must say that is the only thing that hasn’t improved. Amazes me that a high tech company like Apple can’t do bettter in this regard. Camera takes awesome shots in any conditions. Portrait mode produces great results with a definite wow factor. I also love the wireless charging and the Mophie charger I picked up from Apple works a treat. Can’t wait for the update  that will give wireless charging a boost. A bigger screen and only a little bigger than the iPhone 7/8 is a real winner. Much has been said about the notch but must admit don’t even notice it. Dissapointing how expensive the phone is and in particular the way Apple treat Australia where it is even more expensive than the rest of the world. Finally you get flawless and fast performance. Great looking and high quality phone and most probably the best on the market.,Productreview.com.au

galaxy,4,"I picked up the phone on release day to see if there was much of the same from previous iterations of the galaxies or if Samsung actually listened to their customers. Well I'm here to tell you they've done a great job.



Pros:

-Screen - The screen is the best in the business. Colors are beautifully saturated with enough brightness in direct sunlight as well as good viewing angles. HDR content looks phenomenal as expected also.

-Design - Although I'm not a fan of glass on glass phones this is still a beautifully designed phone and appreciate the taming of the curved screen in comparison to the S7 and S8.

-Speakers - Wow, the speakers are phenomenal! I prefer front facing speakers like in the Pixel 2 but these are definitely one of the best sounding stereo pair I've heard. At max volume it starts to sound a bit tinny but I don't play my music or movies at max volume anyways.

-Fingerprint Sensor - I'm glad Samsung listened to their customers and changed the placement of the fingerprint sensor. It's far more accurate than last years S8 and the setup was done in no time as well.

-Camera- The camera on the galaxy s9 is an absolute beast. Colors are punchy and detailed and the variable aperture can really shine in low light scenarios. Low light photos outclass the Pixel 2 especially with noise reduction. Selective focus is a bit wonky with edge detection from time to time but still manages to produce great images the majority of the time.



Cons:

-Battery Life - Battery life is probably the worst thing about this phone. I'm a light to medium user and average about 24 hours on a charge. Although the battery is perfectly fine for my usage I can see how a heavy user might not make it throughout the day. I understand Samsung's point of view on being safe with the battery capacity due to the fiasco with the Note 7, but they could have put a greater capacity or optimized the battery better. I've gotten better battery out of my Essential phone which is comparable in screen size and battery capacity. 



Conclusion:



Overall, I think the Samsung Galaxy S9 is a great buy for someone that is looking for a complete package of power and performance. If you're a Samsung fan or need to upgrade from an old phone and want the latest and greatest then it's a no brainer. If you're looking for a near stock android experience with quick updates then this phone isn't for you. I hope this is the year Samsung finally gets their update scheduled worked out to provide customers with fast OS and security patches in a timely fashion.",BestBuy
galaxy,3,"I have a very annoying obsession with trying new phones wherein I switch between android to iOS phones about once a year. With that said, there are things I like about both operating systems and this is not my first switch between the two. Hence, I recently picked up a new unlocked Galaxy S9 for my latest venture. This phone is sleek, classy and absolutely beautiful. Additionally, it’s very speedy and has very smooth operation. The camera is of very high quality, too. Better than my current iPhone 7 Plus in many respects. 



HOWEVER, I found that the cell and WiFi reception of the S9 was insufficient for my needs and it was subpar to my iPhone using the same nano sim in both phones as well as the same WiFi connections. Granted, where I am located is somewhat spotty at times for cell connection, but it would not pull in the signal as well as the iPhone. In the same exact areas using the same exact SIM card I can consistently get one to two bars of LTE with the iPhone, but the S9 struggled to acquire any type of signal and quite often would fail. The same applied when trying to connect to the AT&T hot spot in my truck. I tested the S9 with both T-Mobile and AT&T and got the same results. 



When you’re in an area with very strong cell coverage you probably won’t have any issues, but when cell coverage is slim you may have serious difficulties. I ended up returning the S9 in the end and eating the $35 restocking fee rather than have a beautiful new phone that I couldn’t use for its basic and primary purpose...data and talking. Had it met those basic needs, I’d give it 5 stars. I wish I could strongly recommend the beautiful S9, but I can’t. Maybe you’ll have better luck.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"I haven't owned a Samsung device since the Samsung Infuse 4g. Over the years I've jumped between One Plus, Motorola, and the Nexus line. My most recent was the Moto Z play which I owned for a couple years. That coupled with the Moto Mod battery pack, would last 3 days on battery. It was nice, but with the older SD620, it was definitely getting slow. Camera wasn't great at all, and to top it off, the screen shattered on me. I walked into BB looking for a phone, planning on getting the Moto X4, but wasn't so sure about it especially since it is almost 2 years old. I knew the S9 was going to be phased out soon, so I took a peak at that, and noticed it just went on sale for $100 off. I wasn't looking to spend $620 on a phone that day, but I did it.



First, the UI of the phone is nice. It isn't as bad as what I remember hearing about the old TouchWiz. It's not laggy, and easy to use. Bixby home isn't too bad, but the bixby assistant leaves something to be desired. I've downloaded an app to remap the Bixby button (can't be done in the OS), but it has disabled the bixby home. Hopefully this might be something that can be released in a future update, but as far as I know about the track record of Samsung updating the OS I don't expect that to happen ever. 



What was nice to see is Samsung has a similar feature to Motorola's always on display. You can get a quick glance of what your notifications are while your phone is locked, without revealing too much information.



The phone has an IRIS scanner that works great for extra security, though I wish it would require you to blink to be able to unlock it. Even in a very dark room it's easy to unlock. Now the fingerprint sensor, I do wish that it was on the front of the phone rather than the back. I run into situations, often, where my phone is sitting on my desk and I want to unlock it real quick, but the fingerprint sensor on the back requires me to pick the phone up. I know, first world problems, but it would be nice to have.



The battery life isn't too bad. With the phones FHD+ screen, and always on display, I have been able to squeeze a day and a half out of a full charge. This could be better if I didn't have a bunch of applications running in the background.



Now the camera is excellent. I've always had phones with ok cameras. The moto z play had a terribly crap camera. The camera on the S9 compared to the Z Play was a difference of night and day (seriously, low light pictures come out great). The front facing camera is also very good. Excellent for doing video calls.



Definitely a great phone, but not perfect. If it weren't on sale, I probably wouldn't have purchased the S9, but for an extra $100 off, I believe it was worth it.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"To be sincere, I was very skeptical about buying this phone because I had heard a LOT of bad reviews about it. Too many to be honest, so i was between buying this one, the Note 9 or wait for S10 which comes this year. I was even thinking about going for my second favorite brand that is LG.

Furthermore, I gave in and i was hoping I was getting my money's worth, and i can say I did. My S7 was a sharm, i loved my phone so much, It lasted me about two years if I am not mistaken, I was only hoping my S9 was an upgrade and not a downgrade which thankfully it was an upgrade. The screen is slightly taller, and the ohone it is thinner which i do enjoy. I thought i was going to have a problem with not having the home button at the front, but in reality, it doesn't take much getting used to. I also thought I was going to take some getting used to with the fingerprint on the back, but that wasn't a problem either. Love the graphics of the phone and LOVE the battery life most of all! My phone lasts all day and I use my phone frequently. Speakers are great as well, i love that it's pretty loud. No problem with hearing other people either and also no problem with connecting it to my fitbit or any Bluetooth device I own.

I also love the fact that my phone has 64gb internally and I can still add an SD card to my phone.

Phone is super responsive, no problems at all with that and has not frozen on me or rebooted by itself like my S7 started to do (it was old). I definetely recommend this phone.

I don't know to what extent did other people used their phones that they didn't like it or love it for that matter, but i believe it's a great phone. Maybe because I never owned the S8 so I cannot tell the difference. Great phone over all.",BestBuy
galaxy,3,"Switched from using Iphone's to this. 



Here are just a few things that I don't like:

When you receive a text message you can either have it set to show who the message was from and what the message says or you can have it set to say Text Message, meaning when someone texts you it just shows you that you have a text message. So you don't know who text you. This bugs me very much because on my Iphone when someone texts me, it would say who the message was from. Then I could determine if it was something I should view right away or if it was just a spam message (like from a sale from cherry berry).



The next thing that bugs me is the ringtone, notification tone, media, and system are all separate volume controls, which usually would be nice. However, you would think ringtone would me from a call and text message and it's not it is strictly phone calls. They lumped text messaging into notifications. So now if you want to turn your text message volume up you have to here all your notification tones. I have shut most of them off, but I still like getting notifications from some and there is no way to just turn the volume off on those. So the phone will randomly makes noises if I have the notification volume up and half the time I cannot figure out what the sound is for.



One more thing, when I try to send a video to someone it won't let me because it is to big. I am only trying to send a short little 1 minute video and I believe the biggest I can send is 15 seconds. This is just ridiculous to me. I can't send send a partial of a video without cutting the video down to size loosing the rest of the video completely.



Also the keyboard on this phone really sucks. I know you can change it but, it is set up the same way on the iPhone and it just adds random letters or words or doesn't type the word.



I know it has taken some time getting used to this versus an IPhone but there are just those couple things that almost make me want to switch back.

galaxy,4,"This is my first unlocked smartphone buy in USA. The sales person was real honest and explained me about the product details/offers. I used lyca prepaid sim (lyca uses T-mobile network) and it started working instantly. Data speed is high. Don't know if this phone will work in India, experiment that in the next month during my vacation, hope this will work with the networks in India as well. So far this phone works great. It was 38% when I bought this mobile, the whole night i played around the options and settings (got a little eye pain may be i have to adjust the resolution or contrast) and after 5 hours the mobile started getting little heat, i will continue to monitor the performance of the mobile for the next 14 days.



pros: current phone with almost all options, good camera. Got a freebie of Home monitoring kit, dont know how to use it but will give a try this weekend.. :)

cons: phone is getting heat after 3-hrs. Compare this model with Samsung.com. With samsung online, you could save some 60-70$ bcos there is no tax charged. I should have done this thru Samsung site, I thought I could save some dollars by going with Best Buy Credit Card. But no much difference becos of the Tax. So, unless you get big rewards or discounts, dont go for Best Buy credit cards, thats waste of time and one additional unnecessary hard credit check. 5% reward back, 25% accessory/other bundle offers...STILL the Tax amount you have to pay to BestBuy will be more than the savings.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"I have always had Samsung since the smart phones began. My S7 was damaged and the insurance had expired. After checking the prices, the S9 was only $100 more than the S7. It is all right so far, a lot I need to learn before I can say for sure. There are a few things I do not care for.



I do not like the the home or back buttons on the screen. Nor do I like the way you send a call. No more just finding the name and swiping to the right. I guess I will get use to it. If not I have 30 days to exchange it for another S7. 



The camera was rated high on the reviews, which was one reason I went with the S9. I am not impressed. I can see a small difference in the quality. Maybe once I read and experiment with it, that will change also. Do not care for the way the picture folders are setup, nor being notified when contacts update their pictures. Too personal and I will change that once I figure it out.



Had to make changes to get it to connect to my Sony Android TV. Though the websites said they were not comparable. Started to return it before I researched it. 



The search and download speed is a bit faster, but the upload speed is a bit slower than the S7. I am just getting use to the apps button being replaced with swiping upward. 



And finally this Bixby thing keeps trying to turn itself on, after I disabled it.



I have only had it for a few days so maybe I am speaking to soon. But I will update my review once I decide.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I purchased this phone with high expectations and they have been met.

Though I originally thought to buy it new I ended up going with the open-box excellent option and have NOT been disappointed.

True to their title the phone was in excellent condition and I personally couldn't and still can't find a single bit of damage. It was essentially brand-new; but considerably cheaper.



All that aside the phone runs great and has soo many useful (for me) features in comparison to my previous Samsung, the S5 Active. That thing was long overdue for a replacement and I couldn't have asked for much more out of one at the price.

I wish they would have included the second rear camera on the smaller version as the 9+ was just too big to me; but that isn't a deal breaker.



The camera is Amazing and so is the screen.

With pictures I wish I could take pictures larger than 4:3 without compromising picture quality; but that's a limitation of a 12mp camera I suppose.



And then there is YouTube which like most all video apps or video players won't fill in the entire screen due to most all video today being shot in a 16:9 aspect ratio; whereas i believe this phone has a 18.5:9 ratio.

You can zoom in on YouTube thankfully, however it does cut the image off a bit.

But for MOST videos it's not too bad.

They have really changed and I am very impressed with how the phone handles the interface tweaks. Some of the big things I would like to point out.



Battery - 

 I am getting excellent battery life. I have used it on long rides and have been getting 8 to 10 hours of display time. Enough to last me through the day. I don't find myself needing to reach for a charger until it gets very late at night.



-Dex

Dex is greatly underrated. I am a teacher given a 6 year old laptop to use for work. I instead got a monitor and cable. I can do everything from writing in word to grading papers. Grabbing my phone when I leave reduced my amount I had to carry around to just a phone. 



- Samsung tweaks

The tweaks samsung does only add to the experience of the phone. Not only can I ""cast"" my phone screen to my chromecast/android Tv at home, I can with other devices. Granted some of these devices are samsung branded devices. I found my Microsoft wireless display adapter I got for my surface works with my phone. 



Some of the tweaks I don't care much about can be shut off. I didn't care for the edge screens. Without much effort they got shut off. Anything that I don't like can be changed or tweaked. Want to swap the back and app view, no problem. Want to download a theme to change to make them look more ""android"" no problem. Want to change the colors of the notification quick access no problem.



I can go on and on about how much I enjoy this phone. I look forward to getting more notes from samsung.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I'm just going to say it, I absolutely 100% love this phone. I had a Pixel 2, which is a great device, but unfortunately it took a dive and was broken. My girlfriend and I were looking to switch carriers, so I played it extra safe by buying the unlocked version. Since I first powered this phone up I've been in love. It is fast, responsive, the screen is outrageously gorgeous, and it has everything an Android User could need. 



I would say, for first-time Android users it could come with a difficulty curve especially if you're coming from Apple, but it'll just take some time to master the phone. A lot of people take swings at Samsung's ""bloatware"" but I've honestly enjoyed many of the apps they load the phone with. Samsung Internet is great and secure, and if you have to switch into Secret Mode (Their version if incognito) you can set it to require a password or your fingerprint for extra security (and requires you to do it again should you move from that screen). The other apps have been great and helpful: Samsung health, for working out or managing diet, or even their base messenger app, which I believe works pretty well. 



I would say if you've been interested in Samsung or unsure, go check out a preview model at your local BestBuy/Service Provider. It's a great phone and is wonderfully crafted. Great job, Samsung, I believe you have another faithful buyer if you keep up the quality that this phone brings!",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I've had iPhones for years, but not because I prefer apple but because I always liked the app store. Recently I decided apple wants just way too much for their products so I started comparing the specs of the S9 to the iPhone XS. The S9 does almost everything as well if not better than the iPhone XS on paper and the phone is a few hundred dollars less, so it was a win win for me. I was expecting a nice phone when it arrived but it exceeded all of my expectations. Not only is the phone aesthetically pleasing but it also has the nicest screen of any phone I've handled. The part that I was nervous about was the app store, and I can safely say that Google play has just about every single app you can find on the apple app store. Anyone who is looking to switch from apple I honestly recommend the S9 it will blow you away. And I had the opportunity to compare the iPhone XS Max to the Galaxy S9 because a family member bought the iPhone at the same time I bought this Galaxy S9. Everybody has an opinion in this world but I honestly like the S9 way more now that I've had a few weeks to compare the two.

This phone is the best smartphone on the market. It's faster at processing commands than the iPhone 8,x,xs,x max etc.

I gave this phone 1 star because the camera is nice, and battery seems to last long. Other than that for basic use, there was not much point in upgrading.",BestBuy
galaxy,1,"I bought 2 Samsung Galaxy S9 back in March from Samsung.com. 

My first issue was when they charged me for my exchanged S7 device that they claimed had physical damage but from the pictures they provided showed nothing more than normal wear. Calling and calling did no good to get anything done and just run around in circles. They couldn't even provide the IMEI of the returned device to prove it was even the one that I sent to them. 

I went to sell my Samsung Galaxy S9 because I was so mad from this experience. I sold the phones that should have been unlocked since I paid full price for the phones. But the phones were locked to T-Mobile and T-Mobile couldn't unlock them. I called Samsung and they couldn't unlock the phones either sending me in circles. I asked the reps why they would send me a phone I paid full price for locked and why they wouldn't unlock the phone. 

Samsung has the worst customer service and I highly recommend getting a Google Pixel or another Android device.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"There isn't much of a difference between my S7 and my S9. There are features on the camera that allow me to do different things but not to the point where I would waste money on it again if I had to choose to wait for the S10. I purchased the S9 because my S7 had horrible battery life and the operating system was so slow. The phone is much lighter and smaller than the S7. The unlock feature with my face is an interesting feature because there are times when I want to just check the time and my phone unlocks without me wanting it to. Also,the biometrics are on the back of the phone unlike the S7 where it was the home key, so that took a little bit getting used too. Again I stress that the camera isn't a significant upgrade from the S7, you could tell there was improvement but I again would wait for the S10 to come out. The Bixby button on the side is useful,I don't use it for much, it isn't as useful as one would think but the bottom doesn't get in the way.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,Galaxy S9 is very similar to my old galaxy S8 with a few improvements. Easy to upgrade from galaxy S8 with the Samsung Sync and their cable. Just make sure on many apps you login and save your status because not all your data will be moved over unless it's saved in the apps account.,BestBuy
galaxy,5,"Don't let the outside fool you into thinking that nothing has changed. The S9 is incredible. Loaded with power, efficiencies and features, it will take your breath away! Nearly everything about it can be customized to match your taste and how you want to work and play. The S9 is the new standard for mobile.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I had an S7 and had to upgrade due to it not charging, staying charged or the cords wanting to stay in. I had no choice but to buy the unlocked phone outright, but it's been great so far. I love the facial recognition option to unlock the phone. Phone's battery is great so far. I really like it.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"I really like the phone, the camera is amazing, all the features. The screen resolution is great. The only problem with this phone is the battery. Drains too fast, I seriously don't understand, why one of Samsung's best signature series phone would have a battery life this short.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I have owned other Samsung phones starting with the SIII and liked them all, but I love the S9 phone! It's the best phone I have ever owned. All the features are great, especially the curved screen, and the camera is fantastic. It's larger than my S4, S5 or S6, so the dimensions are perfect for viewing texts and videos.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,The Samsung galaxy s9 is a great phone. I got the unlocked version and I love that you can add a micro sd card to expand the 64gb of memory. The only problem is it says I have a voicemail when I don’t but I believe this is a service provider problem rather than a phone problem.,BestBuy
galaxy,2,"I bought an unlocked version due to Best Buy not having any AT&T models in stock, they told me all features would work. Not all features from AT&T will work on the unlocked model, like wifi calling or visual voice mail. Stick with an AT&T phone if you want all features to work.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"The Samsung Galaxy S9 really has been fairly easy for me to learn to use, and takes such great pics!

galaxy,5,"Expandable storage, beautiful 4k display, headphone jack, full customization. If you are thinking of getting this phone, stop thinking and get it.

galaxy,5,"First I wanted a cell phone with a super camera and I made the right pick, the pictures and videos the S9 takes are really nice. Next I wanted one that looks good, and once again I made the right choice. The Lilac Purple looks so nice. Feels good when holding it too, just the right size for me.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,I upgraded from a Samsung Note 3. I considered the S9+ but really like the size of this phone. It's actually narrower than my old phone. It's a major upgrade from my old phone. The battery life is amazing. The only thing I don't like is that Samsung's voice to text seems less accurate than my old phone.,BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I love my Samsung Galaxy S9. It is easy to use and was very easy to transfer files from my old phone to this one. At first I thought I should have bought the S9+ because the phone felt small in my hand, but once I got a case for it it feels fine. I highly recommend this phone.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I switched from Apple to this Samsung S9 worried that it wouldn’t match up to the iPhone X however it has and then some!

Try it out, you’ll be extremely impressed!",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"Great phone, easy to transfer all my files, pictures, vids apps and log ins automatically. The only issue was the Sim card from my S5 was a different size, so I had to go to the Verizon Store and get a new one. If you go to the corporate store, they will do it for free.",BestBuy

New 645 processor seems lightning fast and now can disable Bixby in settings to avoid accidental touch. I'm not sure what else you could want in a phone. I use unlocked version on tmobile and works great. Yes wifi calling works perfectly. I traded a pixel 2 and the hardware on Samsung is superior. I like pure android also but Samsung has done a great job on their little unique functions. Excellent lte reception. Buy a nice protective case as phone is beautiful and fragile on both sides. Memory expansion and headphone jack make a very good product better.",BestBuy
galaxy,2,"The Phone is Samsung which up till now I thought was ""ahead of the curve"" in features and performance. The Display is Bright and clear. The Camera takes really nice pictures. Thats the upside. The downside is. The battery life is a joke. I mean it isn't adequate. I mean it seems like it runs out of Gas super fast, SUPER FAST. The keyboard is tiny, it is Really really small and very hard to type on. Forget about responsible texting and driving. Even the Smallest message requires 120% concentration and you will get into an accident. And ""Bixby""...BIXBY and that stupid activation key are so annoying the second thing you do with the phone is youtube how to disable Bixby AFTER charging the tiny battery. You would be a fool to not get an extended warrenty because the battery is gonna die a minute after the factory warrenty is up. Samsung, you got me on this. NEVER AGAIN Samsung",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I had an s7 that was lagging and getting to the end of its line. I had it for 3 years. Im not a android fanboy or apple either. Ive had both phones and enjoy them just as much. The reason I decided to stick with samsung was because I wanted the headphone jack and ability to expand my memory. I dont think the iphone or any phone for that matter is worth 1000. The iphone Xr was also in my books, but with this phone I get a more manageable size 5.8 and get the nice screen. The phone is really fast and handles all my apps. I use it daily and get enough battery to get me through the day. If you are looking for a phone I really recommend this one or the s9 plus if you want something a little bigger. Maybe now wait a little because samsung will announce their new phones next month, meaning these might drop in price.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"Although it is not my IDEAL phone (I hope that it eventually will be possible to get a super reliable plain Android phone, like a reliable Pixel) I can recommend this phone to anyone not bothered by Samsung custom software. I do development to some extent so I look for phones that aid me with that. Samsung takes an approach where they go ahead and substantially develop tools and apps for their devices. Example: Bixby is the assistant (think Suri or Cortana). The settings, and user interface (UI) is custom designed by Samsung. That said, the Galaxy S9 is a great phone. The camera is very good, it has micro SD expansion and a headphone jack. The screen is very good. Battery life has not been a problem. The sound output is good l. I do not do gaming but I imagine that the phone would be fine for all but the most demanding games. It has relatively new processors and adequate memory.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I actually bought this about a month ago. And wanted to get some use in before posting any kind of review. The phone I owned before this was a 4+ year old Motorola Droid Turbo. And it was starting to show its age. So yes I was way overdue for a smartphone upgrade. So this phone was my tax refund treat for myself this year and it was worth every penny paid for it. Battery life has been amazing ending the day averaging in the 45-50% area. And this for moderate usage (games, music, web browsing). I haven't had too much time yet to play around yet with the camera yet on this. But if all the reviews are correct I am gonna really like it. So unless you are a diehard fan of the note or are just looking for a good samsung phone. Don't hesitate on pulling the trigger on this phone it is definitely worth it.",BestBuy
galaxy,3,"I moved to this phone from my Blackberry Priv and the phone is working like a champ except for one thing that is extremely troubling. That is email. In the past when I reviewed my email on the phone, I could delete the email from my phone but still leave it in my server inbox. This phone, no matter how I tried to set it up, does not allow me to do that. Doing it this way allowed me to not clutter my phone with old email but only look at the new email as it came in. Later on when at my computer I could review and reply intelligently instead of using the micro keyboards on the phone. I'll try again some day, but I am not looking so happy about the prospect. Below I had to select whether or not I would recommend and the answer truly is based on what the friend is looking for so don't go hog wild because I said Yes.",BestBuy

Camera: I am a big fan of the camera because the quality of the pictures is amazing. And that is one of the reasons that I wanted this phone in the beginning.

Speed: the phone runs very well and fast. I dont really know processing and stuff but I've had the phone for a month now and have been running a lot of things at once.

Battery: it is amazing how well the battery holds a charge. I can go the whole night without charging the phone and will still be pretty decent and ready to go in terms of charge for the next day. Battery will last me mostly the entire day with normal use.

Extra: I have a really fun time figuring out the phone things the phone has to offer. The storage space on the phone is really good. Sorry I couldn't add a picture but I'm using the phone to write the review.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"Upgraded from a Galaxy S5 Active, and I'm not sure I don't like my old one better. I'm not a big tech-ie so I basically need my phone to just make calls, text, and e-mail. Not a big fan of the curved screen so far either. Makes it somewhat difficult to find a quality case with good screen protection. The extras on the S9 are awesome if you're into that sort of thing such as camera quality, upgraded photo and video features, new emojis and .gifs. The stereo speaker makes the sounds extremely clear and the music is awesome. Wireless charging available. My only real disappointment is the lack of options with text messages. You cannot change background colors or font as with my old S5 Active without installing a separate app, nor can you set individual text tones for contacts. One tone for all. Overall an awesome phone though and I hope I get used to it soon. Would definitely recommend.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"Another great flagship phone from Samsung. I had purchased Samsung S8 last year and bought this one for a family member, this year. A year without an issue with my Samsung S8 encouraged me to get this new version this time. Samsung has really improved the hardware and software in past couple of year. I am looking forward to get One UI from Samsung to be available on this phone soon. So far, a month or two using this phone, I have not heard any complaint from the family member who is using this phone. This phone has all the latest tech that you can find in the competitors (Apple) phone, plus expandable storage, Iris scanner, and more. Highly recommend to someone who want to switch from iPhone and experience the fun of using Android OS.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"After owning this S7 and going straight to the S9, I am glad I skipped the S9. One of newest features I enjoy using on this is the retina scanner to unlock your phone, and even the samsung pass option that will auto-fill your passwords using just the retina scanner. I don't get much use from the finger print reader. The battery life is not much of an improvement on the S7, I'd even say they are nearly the same in terms of use-time. The physical difference between S7 and S9 is nearly identical too, but the S9 will feel and look slimmer because of the edgeless screen. In reality it doesn't take up any less space in your hand or pocket. All in all, it was a good upgrade if you are on a two year phone cycle. Will I skip the Galaxy 10? Probably.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"Bought the Samsung Galaxy S9 because my beloved S5 was slowly dying. If you haven't used and S8 or 9, here's a little tutorial regarding saving pictures onto your SD card in separate albums...with the S5, you clicked the 3 dots in upper right corner and the menu dropped to allow select, then move. Not so on the S9. To move pictures, you press ""firmly"" on chosen picture, then you can select others to go with it, then the 3 dots, which will show the move section on menu. Not trying to talk down to any one reading this, I am not that tech savvy and wanted to spare anyone else the frustration. 

Have not tried all of the features yet, but love the pictures the phone takes.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I love my samsung galaxy 9, with all its glory and faults. 1st off, I love how the battery holds its charge throughout the day. I had an iPhone 6 before and it was not able to hold a charge for more than 4 to 5 hours. Also, I got a deal for this phone where Best Buy gave us 128 GB more storage and a wireless charger, in addition to the phone which makes me a very happy mama, since I take so many photos and videos. It is easy to use, awesome camera with ar emoji capabilities, and syncing it with Google is incredible. Some of the features I don't like is how sensitive the screen is and settings/applications can be so easily accessed if you're not careful (read: have curious kids). However, with it being waterproof and all, this is definitely one of the best phones I have ever had and am very happy with my purchase.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"My primary motivation for upgrading this phone were 2: (1) I had a second SIM card for a second line, and needed a phone to put it in, and (2) I've been using the Galaxy S phones since about the S4, not missing an upgrade year, and so far i've been happy with them. To be honest, I do not notice THAT much different than the S8+ besides maybe security/sign-in options, however because Samsung only promises maybe one or two major operating system upgrades per phone model, if you want the latest operating system, it seems you always need to upgrade at some point. Unrelated, but I may trade my old S8+ for an iPhone on my second (older) line as it is possible this will allow me to develop applications targeted and tested to both IOS and Android, which was part of original motivation for getting two SIM cards to begin with.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"Phone is about 1 month old. The purchase of this phone was a big upgrade for me. I had a $70 LG prior to this but needed something faster as I was just promoted to a management position.



Pros: Google Maps seems to work faster, so does the text message app. Nice speakers. Charges fast and long battery life.



Cons: Lately when I am doing something, the page or app I am on freezes and I have to hit the back button in order to use the keyboard/continue on the page; this happens several times a day. I have also been noticing the keyboard not fully appearing or disappearing. This phone comes with ""Bixby"", essentially a Siri, but it sucks and cannot understand me or my commands in any simple manner.



Overall recommend.",BestBuy
galaxy,1,"Going back to my iPhone. I had a lot of hope for this, but I was disappointed with the facial recognition only working in certain light conditions which made just getting into the phone a cumbersome process, the bluetooth connection to my fitbit and my home lock was weak and delayed and sometimes did not work without reset. Weak bluetooth compared to my iPhone which always just works. The curved screen causes extended case costs. If all a curved screen does is look nice and cost more, that doesn't justify getting a phone with a curved screen! The wireless charging is terrible. The phone has to be out of it's case and placed on the charger just right or it doesn't charge or charges on and off and makes a lot of annoying noise. I got to the point, after only 3 days, I had to take it back.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"My almost 2 year old 6p was shutting down with 80% battery left and so I was in the market for a new phone already. They're getting more and more expensive and needing to replaced way too quickly now. That said, I'm pretty happy with the new S9. Best Buy had a pretty good deal on an unlocked S9 for $700 that came with a wireless charger and a 128GB SD card. Still expensive, but didn't hurt quite as bad.



The Nexus 6p is a pretty large phone so I was really happy that the S9 is able to have the same screen size as the 6p but the phone is still a lot smaller than the 6p. That was the hardest thing to get used to about the 6p.

So as a replacement phone, it's great, I'm saving money, it's always with me (great for car emergencies for example#, has an ""answering machine"" built into it, contacts etc... The benefit is the extra work the devices can do. Love having a camera handy #although it is pretty limited in nature compared to the pro level camera equipment) .... I'll need to figure this app thing out and how to make the device less of a ""snitch"" and a sellout of personal info to ""Big Brother.""

I really didnt look into the capability nor the specs of the S9, just went to the store, picked it up, and went with it. After 3 weeks of use I can that this is the best phone I have ever had. The battery lasts at least 2 days before I have to charge it, and that is without having the power saving on, and I use my phone heavily. The camera takes amazing pictures and the screen resolution is fantastic. It is water resistant, very fast, super light, and it looks amazing. There are too many functions to list them. I would recommend this phone to a friend.",BestBuy

I've had the phone maybe 3 weeks now and within the first week it had tiny scratches on the screen and I never put the phone on or near anything for it to happen.

galaxy,5,"I bought this phone for a family member during the Black Friday sale. It was an upgrade from a Note 5. The phone comes with a cable that allows all the data from a previous Samsung phone to be transferred to the new phone. It worked like a charm. All the contacts, photos, and videos transferred smoothly. So far, no problem was encountered with the phone.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,Getting this phone was so easy! All I did was change my sim card over and then use smart switch and it was like I had my old phone back but with a lot of upgrades. I didn't have to spend two weeks being frustrated learning how to use a new phone. It was user friendly and had well-timed and helpful tutorials to help me learn about the latest features.,BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I absolutely love my new phone, have had service on it for a week now and have had zero problems. I bought the unlocked version to connect to Straight talk and had no issues there. The camera is really nice and the curved screen is really cool but does take alittle time to get used to. Overall I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone :)",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"I love Sansung products. I am still learning how to use this phone the S9. So far it's been great using it. It has some great features on it. Bixby, facial recognition, hand signals for selfies etc. I'm excited to learn all the features. The only reason it did not get 5 stars is because I have not used all the features yet.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I bought this on the Black Friday deal that got me $200 off on the original price. Samsung is actually doing a great job with improving their phones. If you are the person who likes to be up-to-date with the lastest technologies, start with this phone. It's a great phone to have. Just don't drop it. I recommend a good drop proof case with this.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"We bought this phone on Black Friday. Good price and the phone is working great. Only thing you should know is an unlocked phone does not give you all the features that ""branded"" phones give you. An example: a T-Mobile phone gives T-mobile customers the ability to video talk with other T-Mobile phones. Unlocked phones do not have this feature.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"This phone has one of the best cameras I've seen in a smartphone. It has been an easy transition up from my S5. It's been fun to experiment with and I haven't had to ask for any help yet. My only negative is having no changing weather pictures on the home screen. Also my ring tone did not transfer over, but that is minor.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,The phone has an awesome look and feels great in the hand. The display when set to the highest settings its beautiful especially with 4k videos playing! The camera is better than most! Only complaint is but this might be my fault is the infinity display although beautiful since it curves I accidentally push things when holding the phone,BestBuy
galaxy,4,"I got this phone because of the amazing camera. It is slightly smaller than the S9+, so it fits in my pocket better. The main (and enormous drawback) is that it is Android and so its security totally sucks. Of course Google is tracking every keystroke so that ads are on websites that are tailored towards the user. I hate ""big brother""!",BestBuy
galaxy,4,Been a while since I started using my S9 and have been really happy with my S9. Upgraded from iphone as the new ones got real costly and no regrets. It's a great phone. Fast and the camera is really cool. And the best I can just add a real in expensive Memory card and get tons of memory. All in all much staisfied with my decision.,BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I have never been one for the new gadget out. I had a grand prime phone before and needed more ram on the phone. Best buy had this phone on sell, and was very helpful it helping me set this up. My provider told me only a certain serial number would work. Best buy told me I would have no problem with this unlocked phone. They were correct. Very helpful even after the sale of phone.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I upgraded from a Galaxy Note 5, a device that I've had for a few years and I absolutely love my new Galaxy S9. It feels right in the hand, the fingerprint sensor location is well thought out and it's very snappy. Android Oreo works well. The only issue I have is with Bixby, which almost never understands me or never does what I ask it to do, so I use Google assistant instead.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"My Galaxy S5 has had issues for some time with short battery life and it seemed like I was always having to swap out batteries 1-2 times daily. Saw a good price and what I wanted at BB and with Christmas around the corner, it was hard not to go for the S9 with all the positive reviews on Consumer Reports.Time will tell!!!!",BestBuy
galaxy,5,I had a Galaxy S7 before I purchased this phone and feel amazed by how much faster and smooth this runs comparatively. My old phone was 2 years old but just the sheer amount of new features built on top of the faster phone made it more than worth the tag price. The sound and video quality upgrade are just icing on the cake,BestBuy
galaxy,5,"The phone has all the latest features from a sharp camera to a new feature that mimics Seri, and called Buxby. It operates at speeds much faster than my s7edge. The only drawback I have found is that the cord for charging has a new camera plug that is different than either the standard android cord or the standard iPhone cord.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"Gifted this to my brother and he is super happy..

I myself have been using S8 for more than a year and so, I readily liked S9. 



Pros that I can list are:

- Good display

- Good performance

- Good battery life



Haven't yet heard of any complaints for S9 from my brother.



Totally happy with this purchase.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,We were looking to replace a phone and wanted it to be the lateset and greatest as we tend to hold onto these things a long time. In the world of Android that meant the Samsung Galaxy S9. Every amazing thing they say about this phone is true. To date we're completely satisfied with the decision to purchasae this phone and anticipate many years of good use.,BestBuy
galaxy,1,"With use of a case, the phone cannot sustain a fall of 42 inches. The glass will crack.

If you don't want to pay for half the phone to fix small cracks, you can try repairing it yourself and break all internal components, when you fail, Samsung will refuse to repair it, even though you are offering them money.

So, if you have a 100% chance of not dropping the phone...",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I've only had it a few weeks but having fun learning all the things that I can do with this phone. I've been on hikes and walks to shoot some Spring scenes and try out all the settings, especially Pro shots. A few problems because the power button is directly across from the volume buttons and it's easy to accidentally do a reset so be careful. It's due to the slender width.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"I finally upgraded from my J7 to S9. I love it so far. It runs quickly and seems to be cooperating. It's lighter and thinner than the J7, so that is another plus. The picture quality is sharp and has a lot of fun features to play with (like create your own emoji!). Plus, the price is acceptable, compared to T-Mobile's site....",BestBuy

iphone,2,"I understand that switching from Android to iPhone can take some getting use to but, I wasn't aware that there would be annoying inconveniences. It was difficult establishing an ""Apple ID"" (because of it's confusing codes), which is required to download apps. The tech-support representative didn't even know how. I finally figured it out after by myself after tirelessly switching back and forth trying the different codes. The worst thing about this phone is that if you don't leave the phone unlocked it will timeout and close text messages and forms that you are filling out. I'm a slow texter, and it was a headache continuously having to retext long messages, and filling out the Apple ID application. I'm sincerely considering returning the phone and getting the Samsung s9+.",BestBuy
iphone,5,"This phone is the golden phone!! I love it! It works so good it never locks up, I have GREAT battery life. The IPhone X has a battery life of 10 hrs I think and who is going to use there phone more than 10 hours. Rather than the XS or XS Max there is more battery life for them two but I am never on my phone for 10 hours a day! The IPhone X has a A11 Chip and XS and XS max has a A12 but there is no noticeable difference between them on a daily basis your not going to recognize it. I love my iPhone X and you should get one! Also my Best Buy sales person rocks shout out to her!",BestBuy
iphone,4,"So I bought an unlocked phone by paying the full price. The phone did not have a pin to open the sim slot. And when I started it, it was receiving network which an unlocked phone shouldn't have.

Took it to the store next day and the phone is unlocked but it had a sim card in it which was taken out by the associate for me. 

The phone works fine, but I don't have a pin to change the sim in future. Will have to use a paperclip, I guess.",BestBuy
iphone,4,I love Best Buy but sometimes they have false advertising ads. I bought a new iPhone and the ad had “buy an iPhone get 3 months of Apple Music” but I never got that 3 month trial. I tried contacting bestbuy but after talking to several people they told me it was for new Apple customers but the ad didn’t say new customers. So that’s why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.,BestBuy
iphone,1,"The iPhone X is the latest and greatest when it comes to price. $900 minimum just for the phone. Then there is a $25 activation fee and a $50 case plus any additional accessories like a car charger. I walked out of the store short $1,250.00 The bells and whistles on this phone don't come close to justifying the price.",BestBuy
iphone,5,Got this phone for my son for christmas. He was happily surprised. I really love that Bestbuy offers the refurbished and gently used electronics. They are all good quality and checked out by the pros and it saves me some money. I myself am not an Apple fan but the kiddo is. And he is very happy with it.,BestBuy

galaxy,5,"I use the Galaxy S9 for my work number I currently work for Sprint, so I feel like I'm pretty in touch when it comes to all things cellular. I havent had an trouble with the S9 and I went ahead and bought it outright once I decided I'd be keeping it for a while. The camera could be a bit better (I have the Note 9 too and that camera is fantastic) but its still far better than others currently on the market. The features and customization that Galaxy offers is one of the reasons I love this line so much. I also had an S8 and S8+  and I feel like they top themselves every release. Was very happy to see the fingerprint reader was moved, along with the addition of purple as a color choice. This has been a good, reliable phone so far and I'm very pleased with it.",influenster
galaxy,5,I had a Samsung Galaxy S6 I loved it into that having to switch to an LG for a while and was just able to get a Samsung Galaxy S9 love all the new features it took me a little while to figure out how to do everything on it and not push the wrong button I was nervous about the beveled screen but it's already fail didn't break so So glad I had it in a case. I definitely recommend this to anyone who already loves the Samsung Galaxy phones and even those that haven't  Tried them yet. In has a very easy to use interface nothing to overly complicated just a ton of features Bixby is super easy to use and controls just almost everything on the phone by voice command. The only thing I don't like about it is that instead of having a Samsung music it uses play music to get to the music files on your phone which makes it a little more difficult,influenster
galaxy,5,I currently have the S10e the clarity on this phone is astonishing. I've had it for less than a week and I'm in love with it. Not a disappointing purchase at all and because I bought it through sprint I got free Hulu with it and only pay about $11 a month with a contract free plan.,influenster
galaxy,4,I adore this phone! I got the rose gold one and it so so aesthetically pleasing. The camera is also amazing and as I am a photographer and vlogger that is very important to me. The battery life is also great and the speed is excellent.,influenster
galaxy,5,This phone is amazing. I have not had a single problem with it. I love how great quality the camera has. I enjoy the quality of videos and music. I love the speakers and the battery life. The built in edge screen is everything.,influenster
galaxy,5,"I just got this phone for Valentines/ my birthday and I really like it. It is perfect for my hand. My last phone was huge galaxy edge 6 plus and it really hurt my hand trying to use it. This is more confy and ofcourse everything you love about samsung. Its glass all around so get a shock proof case and screen protector. No home button. All the cool new features. The finger print is easy index in the back. Face recognition, beautiful camera. Extra slow mow and gourgous screen. Ohhh yess way better charger really fast and HEADPHONE JACK 👏👏😂 ofcourse got it just in time for a new one to launch S10 but its ok Im loving it. Oh 2 speakers so sounds great. My last galaxy was really loud too.  Samsung Galaxy S9",influenster
galaxy,3,Battery did not hold a charge i play no games. It lags. Never dropped no scratches. Really expensive to get it checked out by Verizon. It did not meet my expectations that the s8 did. Yes it is reliable. Room for improvement is less curved edges. Samsung Galaxy S9,influenster
galaxy,4,"I actually have an s9+ but I couldn't fund it to review, but they are pretty close in pretty much everything. I upgraded to this phone from an LG stylo 4, and I honestly dont have any real complaints about the phone. I've not experienced any slowness, or problems that are notable. The only thing that really bothers me is the Bixby button. I dont use it, and it really gets on my nerves because you cannot completely disable it. So I'm always hitting the button and it as virtually useless... unless you use those things. Other than that, amazing phone. The edge feature is very nice. Screen resolution is amazing.",influenster
galaxy,5,I absolutely love my  Samsung Galaxy S9. I have my life and everything I need in the palm of my hands thanks to  Samsung.  I love their quality of products and how they continue to amaze me with the new products and technology. This phone has a near professional camera quality & has so many different options to help navigate everyday life,influenster
galaxy,5,"I've just bought my S9 plus and I LOOVE IT! I was always a Samsung / Android buyer and recently upgraded my phone. It is a bit different (in a good way). The camera IS AMAZING, we've compared it to Iphone camera and it took better pictures which was a bit shocking. I still have not had time to explore the rest of my phone but it had me with the camera!",influenster
galaxy,5,Earlier this yeah I purchased a Galaxy S9+ earlier this year. I really love this phone I bought in lilac the color and the look of this phone is so sleek and beautiful I just love it. It's pretty lightweight. The screen is bigger but the display on it is unlike any other. The dual camera on this phone is amazing I absolutely love it!!,influenster
galaxy,5,This phone is amazing! Upgrades from the Note 5. Yes I know plenty have came out but just and no use to upgrade u til the 9+ came out. Mainly wanted it because of the camera and it does not disappoint. I've took pictures and had people ask if I'm a photographer. Besides the camera part the phone is used friendly and has all the latest and greatest stuff you would want with a phone.,influenster
galaxy,5,"I have had 3 galaxy smartphones over the past 7 to 8 years.  I love each one more than the last.  However, the s9 is my favorite.  I like the edge to edge screen, the fact that its then enough to fit in my wallet and dont get me started on the camera.  Leta just say that my digital camera would get jealous of my phone camera if he had feelings.",influenster
galaxy,5,"My boyfriend has the Samsung Galaxy S9, and i have recently been messing around with it. Let me just say, i think it is amazing! Its best feature is definitely the camera. As always, Samsung phones are an investment, but i believe that they are better than iPhones for a bit cheaper price! I 100%recommend trying one out.",influenster
galaxy,4,"Still getting acquainted so not sure how to use all the features. I learn something new everyday. I truly love the camera though, wish the volume could be louder & the airphones it comes with sucks 😝 I got a great deal so overall im pleased",influenster
galaxy,5,"I am not an Apple fan and have been using LG the past few years. However, my husband got the S9, and I was intrigued with the camera features. As a social media influencer, I like having a good camera on my phone at all times. The phone is easy to use, and I love all the new features!",influenster
galaxy,5,"I am loving my new Galaxy S9 so far! The screen is bright with dynamic images and the camera is outstanding. I have been loving all the additional features on this phone. I purchased mine through Samsung since they currently have the best deal, plus I was able to get 128gb built in!",influenster
galaxy,4,"Great phone, love the color. It's very easy to navigate,  has face recognition. Great memory space for extra photos, like always samsung does it all wouldnt ever change. The camera as well is great and the sleek design.  Such a great phone my mom got one as well!",influenster
galaxy,4,This is a good quality phone my sister used to have one of these phones it's a really good phone the camera is really nice and clear and it has a nice edge and it's easy to use and light it is a bit expensive but I will still recommend this smartphone,influenster
galaxy,3,Hardly use my phone don't even know why i bought it lol but i definatly loved my iphone more 😏 not a phone person maybe thats why. I was so hesitant on the new iphone and this one...,influenster
galaxy,5,It's a beautiful phone. I got mine pink and my boyfriend blue. It's really fast. Besy feature is everything. It meets more than expectations! It's the future!. Its really reliable. Battery lasts FOREVER!! I could go 3 days without charging it. I recommend this amazing phone.,influenster
galaxy,5,I absolutely love my phone! I use the front camera to take most of my photos and they come out just great. There are so many amazing features besides the camera too!!!,influenster
galaxy,5,Got this phone with my upgrade. I had an LG V20 before and love that but this Samsung phone knocked it out of the park! I love the sleek design it has the camera quality is great!,influenster
galaxy,5,"I love my S9 bright and clear resolution, great features that keeps you on your phone to discover a lot of things. The battery life is so great !! It can last up to 18 hours maybe longer I only tested 18 hours with out charging.",influenster
galaxy,5,"Amazing cell phone, my husband gift me a  Samsung Galaxy S9 for Christmas and I think it's a regular phone but no have amazing technology and recognition I love it. I recommend everybody try you gonna love. And if you by in Samsung.com you can get a incredible offer",influenster
galaxy,3,"Honestly, I hate this phone and can't wait to switch back to an iphone. It's slow. The icons move all over if you hold the phone in your hand while it's unlocked. Photos are regularly blurry. Blergh.",influenster
galaxy,4,"I'm so used to Samsung products that this device was a breeze to use. I love the size of this phone, but wish that the Bixby button was in a different spot because I accidentally hit or all the time.",influenster
galaxy,5,My boyfriend loves his new phone. It's all he can talk about and it's making me kind of jealous. It's so fast and the picture on it is so clear. So many new features and little things here and there. I may just have to upgrade myself!,influenster
galaxy,5,"I absolutely LOOOOOVVEEE my s9+ It has an amazing camera, battery life, and the glass, so far, is unbreakable (knock on wood) 😂I would recommend this to EVERYONE!  Samsung Galaxy S9",influenster
galaxy,5,My s9 is amazing.  I havent had any issues with it at all.  If you are an android fan and Samsung fan to get this phone. Samsung Galaxy S9 bought at Tmobile,influenster
galaxy,4,"Purchased the Samsung s9+ and was not disappointed. Samsung outdid themselves, the camera is superb, the battery is amazing and they even implemented device management so that you no longer have to rely on third party applications.The device is large but fits very nicely into your hands and is very sleek so it is easy to put into and take out of your pockets.Only issue is the Bixby button, which can be accidentally pressed and ends up leaving the screen on... ultimately wasting battery. I understand they're trying to make this implementation work but I think by trying to force it, it ended up backfiring. Instead, they should have made it by double tapping the power it brings up bixby instead of creating an entirely new button, which is very inconveniently placed.",influenster
galaxy,5,"I was a Iphone lover, well as I notice that I needed to get a new phone obviously I was going upgrade to the newer version. My husband suggested to look into The Samsung, trust me when i say i didn't know how many things you can do with this phone. This phone is amazing with the camera, and awesome features it has wow, I will never go back to an iphone again. BTW yes if your a iphone person yes it may take sometime to get use to it. You will love it! :)",influenster
galaxy,5,Finally switched after years of apple use to android mostly due to needing an adaptor for wireless headphone on apple 9 and X. It was a bit harder getting used to but the biggest difference is the amazing picture quality and the battery life. No longer am I tied down to chargers. And not needing to replace chargers is amazing also. Thanks Samsung for designing a great phone. I would have gone with the S9 plus but needed a phone that would fit into my uniform pocket at work and that's a bit too large,influenster
galaxy,4,"I currently have this phone through Sprint. I really like it! I've been using iPhone for the past 5 years so I had to get used to Android again. Let me tell you, a lot has changed lol. I love this phone, but I have issues from time to time loading stuff; even on my wifi, and I had no problem at all with my iPhone. It's not detrimental and it usually functions fine. The features and usability of this phone is amazing!",influenster
galaxy,2,"While your using your phone, make sure you dont burn your hand as this phone gets hot thru using the phone, charging the phone, or even just keeping it to the side. This phone is not a food phone as I have had to get 2 other replacements as the inside gets too hot and messes with the phone (not operational)",influenster
galaxy,5,I have had several iPhones and with some troubles with mine a week ago I went to Verizon and had to get away from iPhones all together. I have had this phone for a couple days now and it's been the best phone I've ever had. The cameras better and the sound quality is amazing. I will never go back!,influenster
galaxy,4,I am using this phone from last april..n it worked good but last month it stopped charging saying moisture detected in port..n i had to take it to samsung repair center and they changed the charging port chip..thats very off because Samsung says its a waterproof device,influenster
galaxy,5,"This is the phone I switched to after having an iPhone for years. Although it has a somewhat hefty pricetag, its sturdy and i can guarantee its going to last me for a long time.",influenster
galaxy,3,This phone has alot of good up grades but the durability of the phone is horrible. If you even bump your phone you it will dent the crap out of it. And if you drop it the phone is done. Recommendations is to get case and screen protector,influenster
galaxy,5,"I have the s9+ and I love it! The camera is awesome, it has Google assistant, Bixby and facial recognition and Iris scanner. Great phone! I like it better than the iPhones",influenster
galaxy,5,I love this phone! I have always had Samsung but my husband traded in his iPhone for the S9. We love the camera. We can get great pictures of our little one without pulling out our giant camera.,influenster
galaxy,4,"I really love this phone. It has a wonderful camera, I can take a very great picture. The only problem is the battery, it is not a very long duration, I have to charge twice daily.",influenster
galaxy,5,"I have the Galaxy s9 now. I broke the screen on it 2 months ago and it is still kicking. I love the feautures on it, It's quick, easy to use and i love the camera.",influenster
galaxy,2,"The battery is not that powerful,  the quality of the screen and the pictures is terrible and i paid it so expensive i really regret getting this phone",influenster
galaxy,5,Love this phone! I previously had a Samsung Galaxy S6 and finally upgraded to this phone. I love all of the features and it has a great battery life.,influenster
galaxy,5,"My last 3 phones have been Samsung..I love them..The S9 takes great pics, the size is good..not too big or too small..I always recommend Samsung 😃",influenster
galaxy,5,Just got the phone two weeks ago . I love the camera especially the slow-motion.  I like that it has a wireless charger if you choose to buy it .,influenster
galaxy,4,I have always loved Samsung products I love my s9 the only issue I have is the camera makes everything look so wide. But I recommend this,influenster
galaxy,5,I have the galaxy s9+ and it has been the best samsumg phone I've had. I wish the camera were a but better but overall I love this phone,influenster
galaxy,3,Worked awesome for the first few months and now it's acting all weird with random pop ups and little mini freezes. Has awesome camera.,influenster
galaxy,5,I love the upgrades from the s8. The camera on the s9+ is amazing. And overall quality is great. I do hate how many updates there are,influenster
galaxy,5,Very intuitive technology I love the retina scanner and the updated features I use my phone for alot of freaking and fitness tracking,influenster
galaxy,5,I'm OBSESSED with this phone. I switched over from apple and didn't have any issues with the new software. Best part is the camera,influenster
galaxy,5,Just got it but I love it! It's so pretty. It doesn't seem like there are any interesting new features. I hate bixby but oh well,influenster
galaxy,5,"Probably best device out there in a while.  I love all the updates and the camera is out of this world,  pictures come out perfect.",influenster
galaxy,5,"I've had past samsungs but this one is amazing!!! Love the Samsung s9s curved edge, the fact it can get wet is the best plus!!",influenster
galaxy,5,"I love Samsung product due to being able to add a micro sd card, something Apple doesn't offer. Also, they're sturdy phones.",influenster
galaxy,5,I love Samsung. Their battery lasts wayyyyy longer than ape iphone. Just recently upgraded to the S9. Loving it all the way!!,influenster
galaxy,5,"I've had Samsung galaxy's for awhile, 5, 6, 7 and so on, I love my phone so much not sure if ever switch from a galaxy haha",influenster
galaxy,5,I've been a huge fan of Samsung products for years. This phone lives up to the brand and continues to impress,influenster
galaxy,3,Not too much better than the Samsung Gateway S8. The screen sometimes doesn't work. The camera still sucks.,influenster
galaxy,5,Amazing!! Has to be the best phone I've ever had.  I really like the sleek look with no button on the front.  The finger printer sensor works quickly and I find paying using contactless very easy.  My only criticism is that the battery isn't lasting as long as I would like.  After a year I can't get through a day without at least two charges.,influenster
galaxy,4,"I love this smartphone as it is the one I am currently using. It has an amazing camera, an impressive amount of memory and the infinity display is astounding. The only downside is the battery life, it can last a full day, however, this is something that can be improved. The charging time is super fast and the phone is elegant and beautiful.  Samsung Galaxy S9",influenster
galaxy,5,I am soo glad I upgraded to this phone. I've always had Samsung phones but this is by far the best. Love the sleek design and the amazing features. The battery life is unreal and the phone itself is very durable. Definitely would recommend this phone to anyone.,influenster
galaxy,5,"Always had samusungs and I love this version. I like the curved edges and updates from previous Samsung's, I've dropped it a couple of times and don't even have any scratches which I am impressed by. The camera is very high quality which is great.",influenster
galaxy,5,Este es un telefono de impacto :O es hermosoo!! su camara es fantastica y para navegar en internet es muy rapido ♥ Yo recomendaria todos los telefonos de esta marca la verdad son perfectos ♥,influenster
galaxy,4,I had  a flip phone for emergencies. Went on a family plan so my daughter got me a Samsung Galaxy and love everything about it. It's affordable with lots of space and the camera is really great.,influenster
galaxy,5,"Smoothest phone experience I've had. My job requires me to test phones, so i've used quite a few. Every other phone I've used has been quite laggy and slow, I've also often kicked out of apps for random errors. My s9 has caused me absolutely no issues, the touch screen is very responsive. The camera is incredible quality, probably the best I've used, although the slo-mo isn't as good as I thought it would be, you have to sacrifice the quality by a lot to do a slo-mo video. The sound quality is also amazing, if you have this phone and haven't enabled Dolby atmos in the settings I highly recommend you do.",influenster
galaxy,5,"I love my phone! I switched to this phone from my iPhone 7, because there's a lot more you can do with Android phones, and I was honestly really scared that I would regret it, but I don't. Not once have I had the thought that I hate this phone. It hasn't given me any problems, the camera quality is good, it has long battery life, and it also is water resistant, which I can prove is true, because two days ago my phone fell in the bathtub, and it's completely fine. I have the S9 in their exclusive purple colour. I think it's great, and definately recommend!",influenster

galaxy,5,"To say Samsung has really brought the full force of the smartphone into S9 ,it has the best camera quality that i have seen in any of the smartphones but it is a bit costly and for this price point it has lot of features !!",influenster
galaxy,5,Omg love this phone and its features! The camera quality speaks for itself. It delivers sharp amazing shots. And the manual camera is awesome too! The battery life is great the rest of the feature dont even get me started on it  just speechless. Worth the buy worth it for any andriod person or apple to android,influenster
galaxy,5,Best smartphone I have ever bought! I've always been a Sony girl but recently decided to give Samsung a go. Definitely the best decision I've made.

galaxy,4,I like the phone minus how breakable the screen is.  Even with a case in it I have managed to put two major cracks in it,influenster

galaxy,5,Waaaaaaaaaaaaaw its beautiful and very veri veri nice !!! I loved so much !!!!! Amazing !! His color is very cool,influenster
galaxy,5,"I have the s9 plus which has a bigger screen, battery and dual camera. The s9 and the plus are fantastic phones. Leaving apple to samsung was the best thing I ever did. There are some features about this handset I love the most-it has 2 speakers on the front, so is much louder than  other Samsung's-it still has it's headphone/aux port and comes with fantastic headphones.- you are able to customise the look of the screen, keyboard, fonts, colours and app icons by applying themes which is a preinstalled app- the screen is fantastic, the phone is easy to use and looks beautiful It has other features like iris unlocking, ar emoji, slowmo mode etc.If you like android, or want to change manufacturer then this is a good place to start. Couldn't live without my trusty samsung",influenster
galaxy,4,I really love samsung in general .. this cell is just perfect and so easy to uses ... i  had samsung 6 abd this was  amazing very easy to use .. maybe the camera is less professional then the camera of iphone but i still in love with samsung because like i said is to easy to use .. so i really want to have this samsung 9 🎀🎀,influenster
iphone,5,"Pros: This is easily the most outstanding gadget I have ever owned. I was dreading losing the home button and having a smaller phone in my hand but my wifeâ€™s 6s Plus now seems like it was from a different era. The Face ID, 3D Touch, Swipe System and Touch to Open all work like a dream, meaning I can whizz around the phone with minimal thought and effort. The size is perfect, after loving the larger Plus series I now realise the X is better balanced for me without reverting to a smaller screen. I love being able to swipe between open apps without having to manoeuvre my thumb up and down the screen, meaning, with my poor memory, if I wanted to write down something from, say, the calculator into notes I can do so easily with a flick of my thumb. The wireless charging is outstanding, so much so, Iâ€™ve bought chargers for my bedroom and my lounge and hope I never have to go back to plugging the cable in again. The screen is absolutely stunning. Watching videos and looking at photographs is a pleasure and, in all honesty, makes me want to watch more which Iâ€™ve never bothered with before on a phone. The camera also seems much better but Iâ€™ve not had chance to experiment yet as itâ€™s something I need to learn more about. Overall, I was worried about taking a punt on the X but I know now that if Iâ€™d not upgraded (as was my plan) or gone with the 8 Plus, Iâ€™d be pretty gutted right now. Apple has managed to reignite my love of the smart phone again with the most perfect bit of kit I could have imagined. Thank you!Cons: The cost is absolutely crippling for people like me. Luckily I got a fair forces discount (20%) on the contract price which brought it into my range, though still massively top end. The only other problem I have is the reachability function. Itâ€™s something I use often but struggle to get right on the X, especially when thereâ€™s something to activate right where my thumb will be when I attempt to swipe down. I dare say, without my wireless charger next to my chair, the battery could be an issue as Iâ€™m a heavy user of the phone, so I canâ€™t say either way with certainty at the moment.",influenster
iphone,4,"This was a very nice upgrade from my iPhone 7. I do miss the home button at times but itâ€™s been a week and Iâ€™ve gotten used this phone. I love how it scans your face to unlock your phone, thatâ€™s actually pretty dope! The camera quality is so much better than my old phone which is nice since Iâ€™m big on photography. I gave it a 4 starts because for some odd reason the camera in my Snapchat is extremely zoomed in and I canâ€™t fix it. I read online they are working on an upgrade for Snapchat so that itâ€™s not so zoomed in. Other than that I love this phone. #newphonewhodis",influenster
iphone,5,"This is technically for the iPhone XR, since I canâ€™t seem to create a review for that specific product. I LOVE the iPhone XR. Itâ€™s a great compromise between quality and value (I did not want a phone that retailed for 1k+). Performance is fantastic. Excellent battery life. Every once in a great while, the touch screen is slightly non-responsive, but it corrects itself pretty quickly when that happens. The camera is excellent, though not as amazing as everyone makes it out to be. Definitely recommend this phone.",influenster
iphone,5,"I was skeptical about getting this new phone. I love Apple. I love the iPhone. I just didnâ€™t know about upgrading to a new version of it.ðŸ˜‚ I am stuck in my ways. But, I love this phone. It took a bit to get used to. Not having the home button and the new way of screenshooting. Itâ€™s actually a good change. It was worth it. Not bigger that the iPhone 6 really. Just there is more screen room so it seems way bigger. I am happy I took the step. I would recommend it.",influenster
iphone,5,I have the iPhone XS Max and I absolutely love it. Itâ€™s expensive very but I think itâ€™s worth the price esp for the camera and I take a lot of photos. This phone absolutely meets every expectation I expected of it. I would recommend an apple phone to anyone or any apple device I have never had any problems with apple and I have had every apple phone since the 3GS. Love love love apple!,influenster
iphone,5,"I love my iphone X, its sleek, stylish, great display(OLED), always fast. I recommend this over the Xs since its only $900 if you can still find them at non apple retailers since Apple officially discontinued this model due to the fact that they want to sell the Xs'.",influenster
iphone,5,"I absolutely love this phone. I love that it takes love pictures so if someone or something suddenly moves, you can go back in the moment of taking the picture to chose where the person or thing was in the picture. I have dropped my phone in the toilet (I know yuck) while doing my makeup and got it out and have had absolutely no problems with it.",influenster
iphone,5,"Its great I love it its so different,special and stunning its really cool,especially the face locksrceen even though its little expensive it deserves every buck i put in it totally recommended and one of the best features is the 3d talking people really cool really special I would totally recommend it to others",influenster
iphone,4,"I like my phone, it is fast and I like the screen on it. However, I think that it is too expensive for what it does. I honestly just really like the face recognition because you don't need to keep typing in your password but overall I think that's what I paid for. The camera could be better and so can the resolution.",influenster
iphone,5,I love my iPhone X. Granted it is not much different than the 9 but it does have a few perks to it. I like the sleep look of the phone and I love IOS!! Itâ€™s easy to use and the sleek design is very appealing. I have been using the iPhone since the very first one. Iâ€™m a dedicated iPhone fan!!,influenster
iphone,4,"I love a phone that fits in my small hands and I never upgrade to just get the new best thing. So this was a first...I upgraded just to upgrade. I am not disappointed. The facial recognition is intuitive and fast, camera is upgraded with amazing portrait options and 4K video is a reality. I am just getting into the features but if you are charging me 1200 for a phone, when I could buy a new laptop, it had better live up to expectations and then go beyond. So far my fav feature is the enlarged screen and intuitive lighting. Believe it or not, I can now browse my phone as it dims itself when putting the baby to bed without him getting distracted. Mom win!",influenster
iphone,5,So I have had my iPhone X for about a year now and I love it. Don’t get me wrong it has its flaws. Like when I broke my phone a few months back and It kept calling 911 because when it broke it messed something up with the side button. I kinda feel like the power button being able to do that is a no go.,influenster
iphone,5,"When this came out, my husband and I got this on the sale deal. I upgraded from a iPhone 7 to this. I love this phone. It has an amazing camera. I love the way it fits into my hands. I definitely recommend purchasing this phone if you’re an iPhone lover.",influenster
iphone,5,"I was a Samsung Galaxy Android user, my daughter on the other hand loved 📱 I tried it at one time and just hated it, after using the android and not having that home button it made it easier for me to swipe and get where I needed to be. Now this IPHONE X has completely won me over💯🔥🍎 by far the iPhone X is the best phone I’ve ever used!! There is still so much I have to learn but the camera is simply amazing and A11 Bionic chip just put this phone in a league of its own. For those of you that are use to the home button it’s my understanding that the IPhone 8 and 8plus has the A11 Bionic chip along with the home button your use to!! I highly recommend this phone to either user the X is now very adaptable for the android user!",influenster
iphone,5,I absolutely love this phone!! From all the features to the color of my phone. The price is high but worth every penny. It’s very reliable I’ve yet to have a dropped call. And this phone doesn’t damage easily. I highly recommend this phone to users!!,influenster
iphone,5,"Upon first receiving I figured ... wow what another waste of money! However, the phone has since grown on me. I love the headphone update and the glass design. You will need to be careful and have a durable case because if you drop it, it’s going to crack on either side. The no home button addition was quite annoying at first, but I gave since become more acquainted with it. Once you learn all the tricks and get used to the gestures and motions, this phone is so much more awesome and so high tech. One thing that surely annoys me is the Face ID. It does not always work well, especially when laying down.  My favorite feature is the Animoji and the Portrait Mode. You can basically have a legit photoshoot with your phone.",influenster
iphone,4,"I have had the X since last November and so far have been pretty pleased with it. I love that they redesigned the exterior without a home button or that extraneous space above and below the screen. Also, love the face recognition feature (although there are times that it does not work that well). The swiping feature is super cool and so much easier and more streamlined than before. I really didn't notice a big change in the camera capability, the picture look good but not that much different from the previous I phone. Last weekend my screen suddenly stopped working for no reason. Apple was great though and replaced it at no cost as it was under warranty. Great model, would recommend!",influenster
iphone,5,I’d love to get the IPhone X for the holidays! I have always been Team I phone for the longest time. I have the iPhone 6S and of course would like to upgrade to the iPhone X. I’ve heard nothing but great stuff about the new phone. My best friend has it and raves about it all the time. It’ll definitely be a step up from the iPhone I currently have! Fingers crossed I get it these coming up holidays!! Hehe :)Apple iPhone X,influenster
iphone,4,I went from an IPhone 6s Plus to this phone. My iPhone 6s battery stopped keeping its charge. I really love the size of this phone and the fact that I still have a nice size screen. The phone is slim to fit in your pocket but you don’t feel like you are struggling to push the buttons on the keyboard. I do not miss the fact that there is no home screen button. I had to get use to using the lock button and the up volume button for screen shots. The only thing I’m not impressed with is that at night the facial recognition has a hard time and you have to punch in your code in order to unlock your phone. Overall I’m very happy with this phone.,influenster
iphone,4,I really like my iPhone X. I got it right when it came out and it had some glitches especially in the cold but as more updates come out the better it is working. My favorite feature it the portrait mode. It really makes all my pictures look nice. Some apps are sticky to use since some buttons are in the cut out of where the camera is out. But with more updates the better the phone is getting. The picture I have below I did not edit just used one of the portrait mode options to take. Apple iPhone X,influenster

iphone,5,"I’ve had the opportunity to use the X & it is by far one of the best devices on the market.  The price tag is a bit much, just like all apple devices but it’s features are outstanding. I recommend this device to anyone.",influenster
iphone,5,This is a great product. The iPhone X has a great display and is known for it’s full screen and Face ID. The problem is that there is a notch that bothers everyone. But honestly I don’t have a problem. It’s price is $1000-1500. Which is a little expensive. The iOS 11 has been a problem for the iPhone X but with iOS 12 coming out there should be a lot a bug fixes. But other than that great phone. And great for games and Animoji.,influenster
iphone,5,im so happy i upgraded from my iphone 6 to the iphone x the design is so sleek and looks amazing the camera quality is breathtaking and the size is perfect i don’t think a phone can get better than this,influenster
iphone,5,"The X is simply breathtaking. It is a break from the iPhones that we have become used to, with new gestures, features, etc. The X is FAST and the touch screen is silky smooth. On paper the 8 and X do not look that different but touch and feel wise there is a difference. The camera on the X is simply amazing with built-in optical image stabilization on both camera/focal lengths. The detail is crisp and sharp. This truly rivals a DLSR camera. Music play on the X is better also, maybe its the sexiness of the phone but it is louder.",influenster
iphone,5,"This phone is really great. I took the leap and upgraded from an LG G Stylo 5.7"" Android Smartphone - Boost Mobile and this phone is SO much better. I love the camera and the portrait mode. I’m into photography so the camera is amazing. I also love how durable the phone is. I’m very clumsy and it’s been very reliable. Yes, the price is expensive but it is worth it. Here’s a photo I took on the iPhone X.",influenster
iphone,5,I love my new phone! The battery is much better than other phones. I love the colors and size of the phones. They are a little pricey but most phones are. Definitely met my expectations.,influenster
iphone,5,"I used to be an android user and then a few years ago I switched to Apple and never looked back. This has been my favorite phone ever. The portrait mode makes it super fun to take pictures of my little boys (and, lets be honest, cats). I listen to hours of podcasts every week and the sound clarity is perfect. This phone is FAST. The facial recognition has made my life immensely more easy. I recommend this to everyone. If you’re considering it- just take the plunge. It’s worth it! OH! Get a really good phone protector.",influenster
iphone,4,"Ah... the iPhone X. One of the most popular phones currently out on the market. I definitely wouldn’t say it would fall under the affordable column, it’s really expensive! (Almost so expensive that it’s not worth getting). However, the display of the phone is gorgeous- so glad Apple finally got rid of those huge bezels, they finally released a phone that looks similar to its current competitors. The camera quality is insane on this phone- don’t  even get me started on portrait mode, it’s amazing!",influenster
iphone,5,"This iPhone is the perfect size! Slim with a larger screen than the 6,7, or 8. The phone can be found at any Apple Store or on apple's online website. It has an amazing camera including the selfie mode. We heavily rely on our phones and they make our lives so much easier by reminding us of what needs to be done, setting our alarms for us, & allowing us to put important events on our calendars. It also saves and captures our beautiful memories. This phone provides more security features such as face recognition which is much needed. I would love this for Christmas! This is my #GiftCrush #Influenster #WishesCanComeTrue #OnTheNiceList Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,5,Ok here is the skinny!!! Love the phone. I leaped from the 7+ to the iPhone X. I do miss the larger size. The X size is in-between the 8 and 8+ size. the phone is also narrower than the plus sizes. But the new design is gorgeous and sleek and will be costly in repairs if dropped. It will take some getting used to because the home screen is no longer there but change is good and i am sure every purchaser will get use to it but if  you can't live without the home button there is  the option for  8 and 8+ which is similar except for face ID and the changes to the front camera for selfy and the anemoji which are fun. the notch at the top as some what bother some at first but now i don't care about it. The X is fast and i am sure overtime with software update will get even more advanced and better.,influenster
iphone,5,I want this phone I would love to upgrade from 8 plus but sadly itâ€™s a little to high for me to get but who knows someday lords will I might get to try one or have one,influenster
iphone,5,"So worth the money! I recently started a blog and needed and new phone and camera. We just went with the iphone X and it takes amazing photos! It's  super fast and the user interface is only slightly different from the others. You'll get used to it in no time. I really love the face ID feature too. I was very skeptical about it, but now I love using it to log into my bank account and make purchases. I feel more secure.",influenster
iphone,2,I donâ€™t understand what all the hype is about. Youâ€™re paying 1000 dollars just to get some emojis that imitate you and Face ID which honestly sucks because half the time it canâ€™t even recognize you and you canâ€™t even switch it to Touch ID because they removed that option. I guess Apple is all about one or the other. Also it doesnâ€™t have a headphone jack which I hate. Whatâ€™s the purpose of removing a headphone jack? I find it to be a stupid decision.,influenster
iphone,5,Was very hesitant with my purchase of this. I wasnâ€™t taking to the idea of it but when I got it in my hands I couldnâ€™t put it down. Truly a beautiful piece of tech,influenster
iphone,5,"I have always been a huge fan of Apple products and iPhones, but I had held onto my iPhone 5s for about 5 years and never really felt the desire to upgrade until the iPhone X was released.  I ordered it the very first day it came available and I am so glad I did!  I absolutely love it!!!  The face recognition is so convenient and works perfectly.  I love the upgraded camera features it has and the better battery life.  The change I like most is how they got rid of the home button on the front of the phone.  With my iPhone 4s, I had issues after a while and my home button didn't always work.  Since this doesn't have a button, that's one thing I don't have to worry about breaking!  Overall this is an amazing phone!  I would highly recommend this product!",influenster
iphone,5,"I bought this phone for the camera, and display screen. This phone does not disappoint. I love the new Animoji s that come with this phone. I appreciate that the phone unlocks with my face, but sometimes find frustrating when I canâ€™t put my phone in front of my face. Overall this is a great phone with awesome new features to play with. If your a techie then this phone is for you!",influenster
iphone,5,"Iâ€™ve been an Apple user since the original iPhone, and I do seem to enjoy my iPhone X the most. The camera quality is great, the size of the screen is pleasant, and the phone itself is not too big. It is fairly expensive as most apple products are, but in my opinion worth it. It does take some serious getting used to without the center home button, but after a few weeks, you get used to it.",influenster
iphone,3,"this is actually a great product  like the facial rec feature but i personally think apple is starting to outdo themselves there is no way i would send more than the 1,000 dollars that was paid for the x alone its literally unrealistic",influenster
iphone,4,"The iPhone X is a great phone, albeit overpriced! The camera is incredible -- such a clear photo with vibrant hues and saturation. What I found amazing was that the front camera also offers high definition photos (which, on my past phone, was not the case in the slightest!) I have found the retina/eye scanner to be incredibly helpful. I never have to type in passwords anymore (such a time saver) because my retina essentially serves as my password. My biggest concern is obviously the price. It is a $1,000 smartphone, which is a tough pill to swallow. Overall it's a great, user friendly phone. The lack of a home button was something I had to get used to, but it became second nature in a matter of a few days.",influenster
iphone,5,"My bf surprised me with an early Christmas present, and letâ€™s just say Iâ€™m in love. The screen is basically the same size as any of the iPhone pluses so thatâ€™s a plus hehe. The camera is amazing I love using the portrait mode. The phone is fast and hasnâ€™t given me any problems. I just miss having a spot for a normal aux cord. It is an expensive phone though.",influenster
iphone,4,"It took me longer to live my IPhone X because it has NO button. I actually disliked it so much in the beginning that I considered returning it. After weeks of learning to work without a button, I actually got used to it and donâ€™t know how I lived without facial recognition. When unlocking the phone it actually takes longer to hold my phone up and swipe up versus just my fingerprint. There is a huge upside to facial recognition and itâ€™s passwords!! I donâ€™t need to type them because my face opens any app or site Iâ€™ve logged into. I also love the size of the phone for handling and keeping in my pocket. Quality is amazing for taking pictures and viewing/taking videos. Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,5,This is my #GiftCrush. As a person who needs to take great photos and be able share it through all social media. I really want this product. I feel like it would bring my music blog and social media pages so much more recognition. Plus if I go to networking events with an iPhone X it would seem like Iâ€™m on top of my game.,influenster
iphone,5,"The iPhone X was my first upgrade in years. I preordered it so it arrived the day they were released, and man, was I happy when it arrived! This phone is unlike any other iPhone. I think itâ€™s the perfect size, the colors on the screen are beautiful, and the camera is awesome! I know a lot of people complain about the notch but itâ€™s honestly never bothered me. I really love this phone and Iâ€™m so glad I got it!",influenster
iphone,5,The new Iphone X is amazing!  The screen is bigger since they took the button away.  The graphics on the camera are stellar.  The emoji app where you can record your voice to match the movements of an emoji is beyond amazing.  And last but not least.... the face recognition is unbelievable.,influenster
iphone,5,"Apple is so so much better then Samsung. Iâ€™ve had Apple products all my life. I love the IPhone X, itâ€™s a bit harder to use then the traditional iPhones but you do get use to it afterwards. It is a little bit pricy for a phone but your paying for high quality!",influenster
iphone,5,"Apple iPhone X S MaxI absolutely love this phone, I purchased mine straight from at&t, it has an amazing camera and speaker system on it, it's easy to use,light weight and very entertaining, I can stay on it for hour's, it's also water proof, I can't wait to see what they come up with next, I'm blown away by the performance of this phone alone, although a little expensive it's worth every penny of it.",influenster
iphone,5,I have had a lot of iPhones and most of the time Iâ€™ll get one and upgrade as soon as a new one is available but with the iPhone X I honestly donâ€™t need anything else!! I was worried about not having the home button because I used the Touch ID for a ton of my apps but I figured I would give it a try and I love it!! I also went from an iPhone plus to the smaller x and I couldnâ€™t imagine needing anything else!! It is the perfect size with a large enough screen for watching youtube and the Face ID works amazingly in low light conditions too 10 out of 10 would recommend,influenster
iphone,2,"I hate this phone. I have since the day I got it. Phone will only answer on speaker phone. Will not connect to Bluetooth in my Jeep without doing it manually. Apple has been awful to deal with. When I first started having problems I had it less than 2 months, they wanted me to accept a refurbished phone after paying full price for a new one. Customer service was horrible and hung up on me after telling me that I needed to get an Android. Filed a complaint and still to this day, no return call or resolution. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.",influenster
iphone,5,I love my iPhone X! I was extremely nervous to switch from a home button to having no home button but I got used to it extremely quick. Iâ€™m excited to upgrade to the iPhone Max for the bigger screen but if you donâ€™t mind the screen size then I wouldnâ€™t say no to an iPhone X! #TeamiPhone ðŸ“±,influenster
iphone,5,"The first thing is that i was 90% scared that the new phone wasn’t gonna be what I expected but all my electronic devices are Apple so i decided to take the risk and buy it to my mom and I really love it❤️ I actually use it more often than her jajaja but I really recommend it 😍 if your an apple lover you’ll absolutely love it and if your not trust me, you’ll also love it because of it’s upgrades and more💕 Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,4,"IPhone or Android? Well having experience with both products, I personally prefer iPhone. I like how easy it is to use and the connectivity between other devices is something I make use of. My MacBook, iMac, and iPhone now all connect together which makes everything more convenient. The iPhone X is very very pricy. I do think that it is more expensive than it is worth. The face recognition can be annoying sometimes but it is much better than I expected. It works in the dark which is nice. The camera quality is very clear.",influenster
iphone,5,i would rate it as a 1000 it is big phone and i like it l like to have it one day and i need a ipone i have nevre had a ipone be for nd i like to have on it has grat ge bits it is the bes i give it a 4000 on all of your stuff and i love the culler i love it sooo muah..,influenster
iphone,5,I phone X is one of the best. I have multiple apps and it all open with Face ID. Super easy to use. Just glare at the apps and open. How awesome it that. I can’t live without it. I am definitely recommend this to all Influenster who have a lot of apps.,influenster
iphone,5,"I recently switched from the iPhone 6s plus to the iPhone X and I'm in love.Major changes are the camera. 1000 times better and with self portrait mode!Second there is no home screen but it took me a day to get used to.Also the alarm, calculator etc is in the top left and pull down instead of scroll up.Lastly, my thumb print never worked on my previous phones and I never liked using a 100000 passcode to unlock my phone so the face recognition analyzer is the best.",influenster
iphone,5,I love love love my IPhone X! For years I hated anything apple. I wouldn’t use anything apple especially iPhones. It was too simple and not customizable enough for me. When this phone came out I waited weeks for one to be in stock and I absolutely wouldn’t trade it for by other phone! It doesn’t feel like an iPhone with all the apple perks!! One of the best tech purchases I’ve ever made!,influenster
iphone,5,"I would like get this iPhone and test it for my youtube Subcierses and thx for your help ,I was dreading losing the home button and having a smaller phone in my hand but my wife’s 6s Plus now seems like it was from a different era. The Face ID, 3D Touch, Swipe System and Touch to Open all work like a dream, meaning I can whizz around the phone with minimal thought and effort. The size is perfect, after loving the larger Plus series I now realise the X is better balanced for me without reverting to a smaller screen. I love being able to swipe between open apps without having to manoeuvre my thumb up and down the screen, meaning, with my poor memory, if I wanted to write down something from, say, the calculator into notes I can do so easily with a flick of my thumb. The wireless charging is outstanding, so much so, I’ve bought chargers for my bedroom and my lounge and hope I never have to go back to plugging the cable in again. The screen is absolutely stunning. Watching videos and looking at photographs is a pleasure and, in all honesty, makes me want to watch more which I’ve never bothered with before on a phone. The camera also seems much better but I’ve not had chance to experiment yet as it’s something I need to learn more about. Overall, I was worried about taking a punt on the X but I know now that if I’d not upgraded (as was my plan) or gone with the 8 Plus, I’d be pretty gutted right now. Apple has managed to reignite my love of the smart phone again with the most perfect bit of kit I could have imagined. Thank you!Cons: The cost is absolutely crippling for people like me. Luckily I got a fair forces discount (20%) on the contract price which brought it into my range, though still massively top end. The only other problem I have is the reachability function. It’s something I use often but struggle to get right on the X, especially when there’s something to activate right where my thumb will be when I attempt to swipe down. I dare say, without my wireless charger next to my chair, the battery could be an issue as I’m a heavy user of the phone, so I can’t say either way with certainty at the moment.            Like This?      1",influenster
iphone,5,Received this for my birthday! My birthday is Christmas Eve. This was on my wish list this year and I needed to upgrade my phone. I love being able to send the Animoji! It’s extremely simple and easy to use. I like the changes they made to adapt for a bigger screen.,influenster
iphone,5,"My first every preference in mobile phone! ❤️🤩🥳I used all the versions of Apple mobiles and loved every series! Iphone X was the best release in apple products last year. Display, it’s features, every single feature was new. Camera is the greatest advantage and it alao has portrait mode in it. Price is little bit costly but worth buying! I definitely recommend buying Iphone X who are interested!",influenster
iphone,5,"Great phone! The camera is just something else. Had the Samsung 9 before and although they have similar screen and resolution the camera is better. At least for me. I always recommend it to others, including my husband. Lol",influenster
iphone,5,I have the iPhone XR and I love it. Wasn’t sure about not having a button at first but the Face ID is so fast and convenient! The picture quality on the front cam and back cam is amazing! Portrait mode on the front cam is my new favorite addition! Also for the XR you get to order it in colors which is really nice! The phone is so fast compared to their other phones. I like swiftness of swiping to control everything. Love it!,influenster
iphone,5,I currently made the switch from a Samsung Galaxy S5 to an iPhone X and I couldn’t be happier. I know it is a drastic change but this phone is like a smart computer in your hand. Amazing picture and video quality. Fast processing and I love that it will only unlock with my face. Very easy to get use to not having a home button and maneuvering the different functions. Very user friendly and I highly recommend it!,influenster
iphone,5,"Hands down the best iPhone yet! Great phone, great operating system, great camera, and great overall look. Absolutely love this phone and it’s definitely worth the high price, Apple continues to knock any competitors out.",influenster
iphone,5,Somebody please tell me this is real because do this causes like so much money into stores but I really think the iPhone x has a good technique and like everything is so good about it the camera oh I phones are good but I think the iPhone x is the best I never had an iPhone x so i know it is real,influenster
iphone,5,"I love my iPhone X! The cameras are amazing and I couldn’t be happier. I also do not miss the home button at all, I actually feel like the gestures are a lot more natural now. I really like the size and love the full face screen. I was hesitant in purchasing because of how expensive it is, but I’m so glad that I bought it because I am loving it and haven’t found one thing about it that I don’t like.",influenster
iphone,5,"I have this phone. It was an upgrade from my iPhone 7plus.  I like the feature of Face ID recognition when I unlock my phone.  As this is only able to be done by me.  However, if face not recognized then you can enter password.  The photos are nice and crisp.  The only problem is sometimes my callers can’t hear me and service is bad.  May not be the phone and maybe it is my sprint service that is bad.",influenster
iphone,2,I got my iPhone X in November I upgraded from iPhone 7plus and I hate it! It wa a big mistake literally the only thing I like about it is the front portrait mode and it is so expensive its ridiculous! I would recommend getting ting this phone wait for something new or get the 8n,influenster
iphone,5,"Verizon for Christmas, #paymentplan, merry Christmas to me 😁😁 love the new phone the facial recognition is amazing. Used to be a Droid fan, my teenager swapped me over to iPhones. I’m glad I switched. 👍🏻👍🏻😜",influenster
iphone,4,I bought this to take better photos but I do not see any improvement in my photos. It sometimes freezes up and won’t let me press any buttons (not locked just frozen) I honestly think iPhone just robs us all constantly making us buy new phones and cords to their accord. I appreciate that this one did not crack in the first week so I will say this is more durable than the previous models.,influenster
iphone,5,I love love love my iPhone! I’ve had one since the iPhone 4 and I will never go back to an android device. The iPhone is so easy to use. And with the X you don’t miss the home button after you get used to the gestures.,influenster
iphone,4,"I think this phone is a little overpriced, we bought this for my husband and i really tho there would be a huge difference between my iphone 7 and the X but not, the camera is slightly better and i find most of the new mechanism annoying, i know it just seems to make things easier but im not sure it does.",influenster
iphone,5,"I love the iPhone X. What can I say I have had every iPhone since they came out. I love that there is no home button and that the size of the X is more like the original iPhone. I highly recommend the iphoneX, it is much more expensive then every phone on the market. But in my opinion it is worth it.",influenster
iphone,4,I’m only giving it four stars because I miss the finger scannerThe finger scanner is a lot faster than the phone not recognizing my face at night and having to enter in a six digit code :/Besides that the phone is amazing and has the best camera everEveryone thinks I use a professional camera!,influenster
iphone,4,"I love having a big screen and all of the face recognition features are really nice, but I’m still not over only having the lighting port and not having my headphone jack. It makes it so difficult to charge with headphones because then you either need a dongle or Bluetooth, but overall it’s a nice phone. Although, I do also think that it cracks easier than my iphone6s did.",influenster
iphone,5,"It is a spectacular phone. I am obsesses with the facial recognition opposed to using your thumb. Also, the camera quality is superb. You notice everything and it is very clear. I also like the fact that the screen is bigger too.",influenster
iphone,5,"Besides the different camerra and portrait feature in photo, this new iphone is basically the same the the 8th. But it’s durable and water resistant. I’ve been using it in sauna and steam room but it’s still working fine for over a year.",influenster
iphone,5,I love my iPhone X. The notch doesn’t bother me at all and no... no one mistakes it for a Samsung. The quality of the photos are great and the pixels that are used in the screen make it look great. It’s very pricey but if you can afford it then why not?,influenster
iphone,5,"There are probably a ton of specs on this phone that I haven’t even found but still I enjoy having it. I’d say the price is high for sure, but, I feel all phones are pricey these days. Simple to use and fun to have. I would improve on the face/finger print recognition as I have issues with mine a lot. Overall I do recommend it!  Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,5,"I got this at a discounted price so maybe that's why I believe it was worth every penny. Seriously a huge update from what I was using before. The face recognition feature is amazing and at first I thought I wouldn't be used to not having a home button but after a few uses, I honestly prefer the new swiping to home method. I'm so impressed with this!",influenster
iphone,4,"For the most part, I love my phone. It was a bit of an adjustment from the 6S but it was mainly just little things like layout and such. I love how seamlessly things work. For instance my Bluetooth items connect much easier, however things like turning off connection to WiFi is a pain because it’s automatic. But definitely, overall, it’s a reliable phone!",influenster
iphone,5,"Loveee my new iPhone! I like that it’s normal size, the picture features are amazing!! Who needs a photographer when you have a phone like this! It’s easy to adjust to the new features, only took about a hour to get them all down! The sound is spectacular! However I will say if you’re not interested in the new features it’s pretty similar to the iPhone 6/7",influenster
iphone,4,"This phone is good I’ll give Apple that, but I just really don’t think that it is worth spending $1000 on. I mean yeah it has facial recognition but it also doesn’t have a place to plug in headphones other than where you put the charger, which to me is just a huge pet peeve.",influenster
iphone,5,"Loving my new iPhone! I’ve had it for about 4 months so I waited a while before reviewing. It is comfortable to use, easy to transition from an older iPhone to this one. Being without a home button takes some getting used to, but not too difficult. I really like the facial recognition for when you’re in a hurry and don’t want to remember passcodes.",influenster
iphone,5,"#GiftCrush #contest @InfluensterI am soooo hoping that Santa plans on leaving me the iPhone X phone under the tree for Christmas this year! 🤞🏻🙏🏻Several of my friends have it already, so I have seen it in person and it is amazing!  The picture quality is so crystal and clean, I had no idea how much better it would be then my 6 plus - but wow!! ✨",influenster
iphone,5,"I have he just about every type of phone there is and my iPhone X definitely tops the list for best phone I’ve ever had. Not having a home button takes some getting used to, but once you get it down it’s so efficient. I absolutely love the portrait mode camera setting feature as well. I no longer need to carry my DSLR around with me everywhere.",influenster
iphone,5,"Im currently using IPhone XR. Im loving it so far. Its comparatively cheaper in price thn IPhone X XS and Xmax. It has few different colors, i have the white. It has so many cool features. The camera quality is really awesome. I would definitely recommend",influenster
iphone,4,"Definitely an amazing phone. Camera and picture quality is absolutely stunning—portrait mode is amazing. However, considering it is Apple’s first phone like this, there’s some room for improvement. Definitely need to make Face ID faster and more reliable. If you don’t want to see fingerprints, I highly suggest getting the Silver version.",influenster
iphone,5,"This is a great product overall! The camera, the quality of the display and the smoothness of the software. Video editing and mobile gaming is very very crisp in this device. The camera is my favorite and would completely recommend this Apple smartphone to anyone!",influenster
iphone,5,"I love this phone! The camera quality is great and the new screen quality really takes the graphics on this phone to another level! Well done Apple- it’s still super reliable a year later (even though I wish the battery life were a tad better, but it’s not bad)",influenster
iphone,5,I just recently got this phone as a gift from my boyfriend. I have had a iPhone before but this one is a little bit different then the one I had previously I like the phone for the most part but some of the features are hard to maneuver but it might just take time to get the hang of the changes. But overall I really like the phone.,influenster

iphone,5,"It's a great phone it's definitely an upgrade from my android but it does have some things I don't like. Like how it's literally made only from glass and how one drop and it's no good. I also don't like the facial recognition because someone can just point my phone to my face and they can get into it, but besides that it's alright.",influenster
iphone,5,i’ve been an apple and  i recently upgraded to x .. at first i wasn’t sureBec i like the big phone and this is smaller than the plus but full screen. I gave it a try and i loved it..,influenster
iphone,5,"I simply cannot live without my IPhone X! One of my favorite apps that is exclusive to IPhone is Hipstamatic, a photo app. Lots of photo storage with the option to expand storage if you pay a lil extra a month... totally worth it for someone like me who takes a lot of photos. Runs smooth, love the constant app updates.",influenster
iphone,4,They don’t have the review for the xr so this is mine for it. I like the screen but I don’t like how it cuts into the camera at the top and looks like ears. Pretty much my only complain other than the fact there’s no headphone jack. The camera quality is good.,influenster
iphone,5,great product because i very like it . i see many people use iphone x they said iphone x is very good you can many things on iphone x. so i  very  want a iphone x .,influenster

iphone,5,love this phone that every time Apple comes out with a new version I always end up getting it.  I had family members always telling me Android phones were better but I always disagree.  Always tell em to buy apple products because I never have virus issues neither do they every slow down on me.,influenster
iphone,5,Omggg I got this birthday and omg it was the best decision I ever made at first I thought I wouldn’t like it because of the glass back but now that I have I love how the phone is so smooth and has no glitches the battery also last me all day long without haveing to charge till I’m ready for bed MUST BUY!!!,influenster
iphone,5,"#giftcrush I would love to have an iPhone. I need a new phone and have only ever had Androids with the exception of my iPods in the past. I would love to get an iPhone this Christmas (doesn't have to be a x, just picked one for the picture).",influenster
iphone,5,"A lot of my friends were hesitant to make the switch to iPhone X when it came out due to the absence of a home button. However, after using it for five months, I have absolutely no problem with having no home button. I like the big screen and I actually prefer the swiping to having a home button.",influenster
iphone,5,"I love the iPhone X. Albeit was expensive, I hadn’t upgraded my phone in 4 years so it was needed. It was a great change from the iPhone 6s Plus. Easy to use with lots of extras. I do wish iPhones were more customizable.",influenster
iphone,4,"I’ve had my iPhone X for a few weeks now and I have to say I love the upgrades, but miss my Apple iPhone 7 Plus . I think the best feature of the phone is the camera! It’s amazing and the parts I ‘m still getting used to would be the loss of the home button and the size.",influenster

iphone,5,"Man this phone is awesome. The apps alone are great. The limitations are unimaginable! The IPhone X has met my expectations and has gone beyond what I’ve wanted it to do. It has withstood my 5 yr old, as well as getting wet and being dropped repeatedly! This was a great investment so far!",influenster
iphone,5,Do I have to say this is the best phone ever? I think some people are Apple fans and some people aren’t but I love how easy this phone is to use and how the images come out. The screen is beautiful and is pretty hard to crack. I drop mine a lot and it’s never gotten a scratch.,influenster
iphone,5,I love this new iPhone! I had the plus so going down in size took some getting used to. The camera is so good on this phone and gives professional quality photos.,influenster
iphone,5,"This is the best phone they have released yet! It is very user friendly but also customizable so it doesn’t get as boring as some of the older models were. The screen resolution is amazing. The speakers are very loud, and the picture quality is a force to be reckoned with!",influenster

iphone,4,"The iPhone X delivers a great blend of handheld comfort and a big, gorgeous 5.8-inch OLED screen. The rear-facing telephoto camera outshoots the iPhone 8 Plus in low light, and the front-facing camera snaps impressive portrait mode selfies. Face ID generally works fine.",influenster
iphone,5,"OW.. this iOS the best phone I ever had. In my opinion this phone worth the high price. its a compact phone, and don't think about no home button was something bad..you just need to get used to.  the pictures in this phone are amazing, with many filters to choose",influenster
iphone,5,"A amazing phone! I love it. The picture quality is amazing and the phone is just so easy to use. No home button is great, and you get more screen size. The only thing is the price but then again its apple. All their phones are pricey but this one was totally worth it.",influenster
iphone,5,"I got the iPhone X when it first came out in the silver option. From the very beginning, the screen went beyond my expectations. The design was sleek and nice, but it felt like an expensive device - and for the price that I paid for it, it definitely lived up to it.",influenster
iphone,5,"I'm loving my iPhone X so far. I just got it in yesterday and so far it's amazing. Great screen, colors look so vibrant. The speed is great, camera takes great pictures and video and the feel of the phone is really nice. It feels very fancy and sleek, which I love.",influenster

iphone,4,I recently go this in black and It’s great! It’s different from the other iPhones so it takes some getting used to. I love how it’s all screen on the front so you’re not wasting space on border. It is a little bit heavier than the other iPhones but it’s not bad.,influenster
iphone,5,"This is a definitely a great gift that id love to have, very easy to use almost the same like the old iPhone models but better, meet everyone technology lover expectations, everybody should buy it. #appleX",influenster
iphone,3,"Well, I’ve always been a huge iPhone/Apple user and always had pride being a supporter of Apple products. Both me and my husband preordered these phones, stayed up until 5AM that night on the phone with T-Mobile. When receiving this phone I fell in love with the look of it (Got Silver White version). It took me 2 months to realize that I hate it, I use my phone a lot, and the actual user experience for me was disappointing. Because of the new Screenshot method, I now have 500 random screenshots of my lockscreen simply because of the way I pick my phone up off the table. I CAN TELL YOU AS A MAJOR APPLE USER, I have never had an iPhone to freeze like a windows 98 computer, but this phone does and I have to reset it every time. It’s sad to see this company change its products, Steve Jobbs would be disappointed.  iPhone had a trade mark of being behind in how advanced the specs were but what made this company wasn’t about advanced the products were, but simply how they perfected and simplified something so wonderful. Not anymore I guess.",influenster
iphone,5,"Looooooovvveeee my phone! The screen swiping quality is smooth and effortless. I love that Apple Pay is a thing in most places I shop. It’s a bit too expensive, but I got mine for $160 because of a phone update contract I had with Sprint. The camera quality is immaculate.",influenster
iphone,4,"This is a very incredible phone. The camera quality is unreal , it takes such a clear and crisps photo. The storage is very large capacity. The features are like every other iphone just bigger and better. Very pricey but it's worth it. Great phone!",influenster

iphone,5,"I love my iPhone X and am very happy with the purchase. While it was quite expensive, it was a much needed upgrade from my iPhone 6s. So much faster and better capable. The full screen image with no buttons is definitely my favorite feature.",influenster
iphone,5,I love this phone! I wanna get the max for a bigger size but this phone is great! Besides the price it is pretty good. One down side is the back can crack easily if you donâ€™t have a proper case. But it has a great screen and battery time !,influenster
iphone,3,"This phone is not worth the hype or the money. I upgrade from an my iphone to the 10 because i was egilable for an upgrade and i wanted the newst iphone. I hate that it doesnt have a headphone jack. I also get made when i want to charge my phone while listening to music. Face ID, HATE IT. They give you the opinion not to use it but touch ID isnt available because the phone doesnt have a home button. Its just like every other iphone expect they added stupid and useless features. Who cares about talking emojis, face id is stupid. The battery life is good. For not charging my phone for 9hrs ill be at 65 or 50%. The camrea it great also. It has the 4k live effect going on. Other then thats, thats the only two things i could say its good about this phone, and for it to cost 1000 plus tax that isnt saying much. I also heard apple might discontinue this phone due to low sells. So....",influenster
iphone,5,I donâ€™t have this phone but my brother dose it has the best Quality to take pictures itâ€™s a perfect size itâ€™s not to big or either small I recommend this whatâ€™s is so cool is you can open the phone just pulling you face in front of it,influenster
iphone,3,Honestly itâ€™s an okay phone but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s as much money as itâ€™s selling for. It is pretty much the same as all other iPhones just looks a little cooler than the generations before. Itâ€™s way to easy to crack in my opinion.,influenster
iphone,5,Omg I love this phone the camera is absolutely amazing. It is kind of on the expensive side but trust me it is totally worth buying. To me the camera and speaker are super important and this phone totally fulfilled my expectations.,influenster
iphone,5,I would love this new iPhone it looks and is awesome this would be a dream come true I have never won anything in my life and maybe this can be my chance that I have never had hopefully I get picked but if I donâ€™t get to get this iPhone X Iâ€™m happy with whatever else gets thrown my way!,influenster
iphone,4,"Got this as a Christmas present from my boyfriend. Itâ€™s a really nice phone, but not many apps are adjusted to it. I have dropped it about 2 times so far, and there is not even a scratch. One thing I noticed with my phone is that it lags during multitasking when on a phone call.",influenster
iphone,5,"Love love love this phone! Let me just say I was nervous to have a phone without a home button, but this phone has not let me down! I love the screen and just honestly everything about this phone! Works great and looks great too",influenster
iphone,4,Great phone but the OS can be buggy since the notch messes up the screen dimensions. I also wish it was a bit smaller so you can use one hand at all times. I cannot press all 4 corners with my thumb without adjusting my hand.,influenster
iphone,5,I love my phone! I use it for everything! I film my YouTube videos with it as well! Best iPhone yet! Plus I love not having a home button! Once you get used to not having it you won’t miss it at all ! Apple iPhone X,influenster

iphone,4,I just recently upgraded to the iPhone X it’s way to use it just takes some time getting used to. I don’t like that it only comes on one size I would of loved to have gotten a bigger version. Other than that love the phone.,influenster
iphone,5,"I love my phone, it’s much better than the previous iPhone 7 I had, even though I enjoyed that as well while waiting for the upgraded stuff. So many new things, your personal emoji to use and all. Highly recommend!!",influenster
iphone,5,I would love to be gifted an Apple iPhone X. You can buy them at any phone retailer or even Walmart. They are very expensive but they are super easy to use and super light. They could be improved with better glass.,influenster
iphone,5,"This phone is outstanding compared to apples past products! While the price may seem high, the overall quality of the phone and it’s included features are definitely worth it. It’s sleek design and oled screen are outstanding!",influenster
iphone,5,"I’ve heard so many positive things about this phone! I’ve thought about getting it, unfortunately it’s just too expensive! The camera on it is remarkable! It looks like you’re taking photos with a professional camera.",influenster
iphone,5,"Very high price for a very good phone! And its worth every penny! I love my iphone X! Everyone looks to you like oh you have the iphone x! Its almost incredible the camera, the fastest it is! Everything!!",influenster
iphone,5,I’m a newbie for iPhones came from android. I was sceptic at first but once I dove in was easy and amazing . Not a total transformation from android once u figure out the phone but better experience.,influenster
iphone,5,"This is my ultimate #giftcrush !!! I would love to get this for Christmas!!! ❤️ Maybe Santa will be extra good to me this year! I love watching the online reviews about it, makes me excited to upgrade!",influenster
iphone,5,"I am so excited for a new I phone and I love screen, the size and all the features except the face recognition.  I am hoping for this for Christmas.  It's a little pricey but so worth it!!! Reccomend!",influenster
iphone,5,"My friend owns the iPhone X and it’s the best. I own a iPhone 8 that I love, but so wish I had the X. There’s a lot of new features that I love. I also like thats it’s the size of regular iPhones.",influenster
iphone,5,"I love my iPhone X. I don’t like the price we are paying for it on ur plan. But i never have any issues. I love all the apps i can download, it allows me to message, and call whoever i need to.",influenster
iphone,5,Love my iPhone X. It took a little time to get used to some of the new gestures but it’s really a cool phone. Wished the launches a Plus size already but this is already a step in the right direction!,influenster
iphone,4,I recently switched from the galaxy S6 edge and it was a big difference coming over to apple. There’s something’s I can’t do with apple that I could with android but over all I’m satisfied!,influenster
iphone,5,"I love this cell phone! The missing home button has already been disabled after a while. Wonderful technology, which makes me always keep myself as a loyal customer of apple.",influenster
iphone,5,Love love love this phone! As a mom I mainly use my phone for taking pictures of my kids and the photos this phone takes look like they could be professional! I love everything about this phone.,influenster
iphone,5,Loved the iPhone X and the face-id works 10 times faster than touch -Id. The picture are beautiful and the portrait mode in incredible. It’s an amazing device. Apple iPhone X,influenster
iphone,4,"Before my most recent iPhone (the X), I had the Apple iPhone 8 Plus - 64GB - Gold. The X overall is a great phone, but for me, I’d rather have the 8 Plus back, which is why 4 stars. I like the Face ID, but I wish fingerprint was also offered because you actually have to stare at your phone for the face to work (obviously), but sometimes I just want to pick it up and open quick with my thumb. Also, when double clicking the side button for Apple Store purchases, I always end up taking a screenshot because the volume buttons are directly on the other side, so while clicking with my thumb, my pointer hits the volume down. I also like the round bottom button better than the “swipe up.” I also wish all iPhones had a clipboard like Samsung - Galaxy S6 With 32GB Memory Cell Phone - Black (sprint) (pretty much all Samsung’s to my knowledge), to hold more than one copied item at a time.",influenster

iphone,5,This phone is very great it don’t freeze the colors are great the emoji‘s are amazing and one thing I didn’t like about it is I dropped it one time and it broke The backside broke 😕,influenster
iphone,5,"I loved this phone. I recently upgraded to the Xs, and see no difference. The portrait mode is awesome, it has a sleek and slim design, and best of all comes with so much storage!",influenster
iphone,5,"A perfect phone for this updated life. A very sophisticated device from apple that is totally a screen. That can respond to touch, voice and even a glance. Very nice  Apple",influenster
iphone,5,"I got this phone for Christmas as a gift. Honestly, I wasn’t really excited because I had a working phone and felt that getting a new one,especially an expensive ome like this, is a wate of money. I still feel that way - I would never buy it for myself- it’s super expensive for a phone.However, I love usinh it. The biggest pro is the camera! Ughh... my photos look amazing and people always ask me whether I use a professional camera. There’s a “portrait” option on the camera that blurs the background and focuses on the objects so it makes it look like you used professional lighting. The face recognition is also useful - I don’t have to type my passwords anymore - it saves time. A con, however, is that the phone is pretty new and there’s little bugs that I’m guessing will be soft with the new iOs updates. Overall, amazing product if you can afford it but not a must have.",influenster
iphone,4,"I don’t like apple as a company. I think they definitely take advantage of their customers and coming out with a yearly iphone takes away the fun out of having a new phone because i simply does not last. However after 3 years of having my iphone 6s and really struggling because software/ tech loft in general updates so fast, I needed to keep up. I thought of getting the samsung or google phones but I ended up coming to apple as ultimately they have what the people need and that’s the ultimate technology. So far the main improvements of owing an iphone X was the better camera resolution, the bigger screen, the battery lasting longer. So nothing cray, just updated necessary to keep up with society really",influenster
iphone,4,The hype was real for this when it first came out and tbh it’s nothing different just the fact that it has Face ID and such but I mean it’s a really nice phone tho,influenster
iphone,5,"I’ve had my phone for about two weeks now. I switched over from the iPhone 7plus which in size was a bit of getting used to because my hands were so used to a bigger phone. My home button on my iPhone 7 however didn’t work for almost a year so I was already used to not having a home button when switching over. I love love LOVE how this color looks especially with the metallic look on the sides of the phone. I love the facial recognition especially how I can use it for Apple Pay. A lot of people say my mother and I look alike so I even tried to see if the camera would pick up that she was me and it didn’t!! LOVE IT lol. At first it was a little frustrating having to get used to the smaller keyboard and the swiping up for the multitasking option, having to learn how to use this phone was definitely a mission but I love my phone overall. I’m going to have to start wearing makeup though because, this camera? INSANE!",influenster
iphone,3,"I’m not very happy with this phone, especially with the incredibly steep price. When I first got the phone, I had an otter box case and glass screen protector put in the phone in store the moment I bought it. I’m one of those people who is super careful with their phones. I’ve had significant problems, I got a brand new phone $1000+ and off the batt I had issues. There were blackouts, freezes, random power off, etc. I went to Apple and they tried to give me a REFURBISHED phone. I paid for a BRAND NEW phone, it’s not working, and they try to give me a REFURBISHED phone, after they couldn’t seem to figure out what’s wrong with mine. It’s ridiculous. Apple is definitely no longer king in the tech community. You’re no longer paying for innovation and quality. You’re now just paying for the name. It’s ridiculous.",influenster
iphone,5,"I got my iPhone X about two weeks ago and am in love.  It's great to have the Face ID and the full screen phone.  The resolution is beautiful, and the camera is great.  I thought it would take forever to get used to without the home button, but I've already adapted.  I was messing around on my mom's phone, which is the 7, and I kept wanting to swipe up instead of using the home button.  it's crazy how you quickly you adapt.  I did have some issues with my Face ID not working.  Apple support was great, and I ended up having to go to the Apple store to get it fixed.  I was in and out in 20 minutes with a new phone.  Love Apple!",influenster
iphone,4,Alright so there are a lot of things that I LOVE about this phone. Let's start with the cons. Whenever I talk to someone on the phone it sounds like they're far away or their voice is being muffled so I have to have it on speaker anytime I talk to someone. Since that's not too often I'm able to look past it. Pros: Face recognition. Animojis. 4K camera. The camera is the best part. It's worth it for that alone. The video it shoots is incredible. The portrait mode is better than the iPhone 7 Plus too. I definitely recommend getting this phone if you're tossed up between an older version and this one.,influenster
iphone,5,"I purchased the Apple iPhone X a month or two after it came out and I absolutely love it! It is easily one of the best smartphones out there in my opinion. I can also say it is most definitely worth the hefty price tag. The OLED screen is absolutely stunning and very clear. The color pigment of the screen is stunning and very bright. The edge to edge glass is also a nice feature to have, it gives the screen a minimalistic and modern design.  The size is also excellent, small but the perfect size and the screen clarity is also excellent. The camera quality is close to that of a professional camera. I was blown away by the quality of a few photos I had taken when I first purchased this iPhone. It looked as if I had taken them on a Nikon or Canon. Overall, this was a purchase that was worth every penny. Apple made yet another excellent quality phone!",influenster
iphone,5,"Amazing!!! Just got my new iPhone and I’m totally in love with it! The display is so crystal clear and nice, the volume is definitely louder than the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, which I had previously. It does take some getting use to having to swipe up from the bottom since no home button and the same with multitask, but I’m already use to it. Also new spot for control center, but overall very pleased. Also super fast.",influenster
iphone,4,"I love my iPhone X. In many ways, it's so similar to the iPhones preceding this one. The noticeable changes are obviously the lack of a home key. I find the gestures to be intuitive and I got used to them within an hour of using the phone. Obviously, Face ID is a big change. I would say the failure rate is similar to touch ID with the benefit of it learning as you type in your passcode with failed attempts to recognize you, so it's always learning. The camera is great, which is the primary reason I got this phone. That and I didn't want the huge 8+. This is still comfortable enough to fit in my pocket. The screen size does make it hard to reach the corners one handed though. Still, I'm very happy with my phone.",influenster
iphone,5,"I love my new phone. I love the larger screen without having to get a plus that feels too large for me. Love the camera quality and love portrait mode on the camera for the selfie, allows to take better close up photos also. The animoji is also awesome and fun to send to people. Having my messages locked until it has my face recognized and shows me the messages is also great. I can see what I have without having to go in to each app and see the notifications but it also allows from others not seeing them.",influenster
iphone,4,"I honestly love my iPhone X and I’ve always been an Apple fan girl. However, I had a Samsung Note 8 for a while and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t miss it sometimes! I came back to iPhone after a year and it’s feels like I never left it. It’s all pretty much the same. I do love the new iOS 12 update and my battery life is amazing in comparison to my Samsung. The camera is wonderful. My only qualm is I wish we had an app drawer! after being able to organize all of my apps, it’s hard to look at all those folders/icons again! Otherwise, the phone is fast, camera is clear, and battery is wonderful! I’d recommend to anyone. :)",influenster
iphone,4,"Okay the price is ridiculous. Also, it really bothers me that Apple completely skipped over an iPhone 9 just because they wanted to an iPhone X to celebrate a decade - could've planned for that a whole lot better. But, I really do love the camera. It makes the most basic thing look so gorgeous on screen. That being said, not much else is impressive so if you don't want a super powerful camera, this phone doesn't have much else to offer.",influenster
iphone,3,"Honestly, this phone has been okay. Not my favorite and I really miss my 7. I do love the size of the screen, but the screen is made of a softer glass and more prone to scratches. With my previous iPhones I never had a screen protector and had them for over a year each. There were no scratches when I got my new phone. With this one I had the phone for 2 weeks and it was already scratched. I also do not care for the face recognition. It’s a neat function, but at the end of the day the fingerprint scanner was much more snappy and convenient. And I very much miss it!! Wouldn’t recommend this phone.",influenster
iphone,3,"i stood on line for this phone when it first came out. it was very expensive but i was able to use a payment plan with my carrier. it can be very difficult to learn how to use at first because you have to learn how to do simple functions that in the past required the home button. i do not think the face id is all the its cracked up to be, as i have many issues with it working everyday. i would not recommend this phone to others.",influenster
iphone,5,"Apple has REALLY went the extra mile. I absolutely love my iphone X. The facial recognition is pretty cool. Sometimes it lags and that can be a bit annoying but I still would't opt out of using it. I like the extra security that comes with it. The other big feature is no home button. It takes some getting used to but once you do, it's super natural. I don't know about anyone else, but anytime I get a new phone, tablet, or any new electronic device for that matter, I watch videos to figure out how they work. Saves me a lot of trail and error. I recommend doing it.",influenster
iphone,5,"The iPhone X is absolutely amazing. My favorite features are the Face ID and portrait mode on camera and that there’s no home button. These three features make the IPhone X an absolute necessity! Although, not being able to listen to music and charge you phone at the same time is a bummer. PS. I recommend getting a protective case and a screen protector due to its cost!   Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,5,"I recently upgraded from a 6 Plus and was unsure whether I would like this version better than the 8 Plus.  I’m really glad I decided to go with the X.  I LOVE the facial recognition feature, although it’s not 100% accurate.  It took awhile to get used to not having the home button, but I don’t miss it at all now.  The camera and photo settings are amazing.  As an amateur photographer, I sometimes use my phone instead.  The screen on the X is just as big as the screen on the 8+ so you don’t give up any space.  I highly recommend this phone!",influenster
iphone,2,"I know the iPhone X is all the hype and unfortunately I fell into it. I wish I would have kept my iPhone 6 Plus. I liked it just as well maybe more. I don’t like that they took the headphone port away just to sell back the wire to convert headphones to plug into the charging port. You can’t charge the phone and use headphones at the same time, lame! The only real difference is the Face ID which isn’t even that cool honestly. I am not happy with this phone, I shouldn’t have wasted so much money on it",influenster
iphone,5,"WOW, do I love this phone or what! At first I thought with the home button missing it would be impossible to get past and enjoy it, but after getting to use it for a few days it was no issue at all. THE BEST! THING ABOUT THIS PHONE IS THE CAMERA! Portrait mode will be your best friend! I took some photos at a wedding and most people thought it looked like a professional camera. In addition, the size is just right, it holds up great, and holds a charge fairly well. You have to get the iphone X!",influenster
iphone,5,"I absolutely love my iPhone X! I wasn’t sure if I would like it before I got it but the whole no home button thing took me like 20 min to get use to. It exceeded my expectations and it’s absolutely worth buying! The best iPhone I’ve had so far! But a lot of apps need to update to the new screen size, other than that love it so much!!! Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,5,"I had been wanting the X for awhile and when I broke my 7 plus on a water tubing trip on the 4th of July I legit went home and ordered online for in store pick up and made it to the mall with 20 mins to spare before closing for the holiday. I’ve had the X for a few months now and after a week or two of adjusting to no home button and no Touch ID, I really have come to love it. I do think I will always miss the Touch ID though. I can do without a headphone jack and use bluetooth.",influenster
iphone,5,"Apple continues to out-perform the competition. First of all, iOS is leaps and bounds ahead of the other operations systems, like android’s. The processing power is more than adequate for a smart phone and feels like it will have good longevity. Battery life is outstanding!! Lastly, the screen is crisp, clear and looks awesome.",influenster
iphone,5,This is an amazing iPhone I really love it it has many new stuff you can try many new things I think it's the best iPhone yet that they had made .Right now this is my favorite iPhone I'm really in love  with it I have learned new stuff and it's so entertaining. I can't explain the love I have for this phone it's amazing!!!,influenster
iphone,5,I just got my new iPhone X in the mail this morning and I love it! I got it through my xfinity service and I’m paying close to $90 a month for the phone and my service. After 22 months my phone will be payed off and I’ll only pay about $45 a month for my phone plan and that’s it! My favorite feature so far is the Animoji! It is just the cutest thing ever!,influenster
iphone,5,"Just got mine in the mail and so far it’s great. I had the 7plus before this one so in getting use to the smaller size, however the screen is much longer so it doesn’t feel like such a big difference to me. Facial recognition works! It works with my glasses and without. I even used it with a sheet mask on and it worked also.",influenster
iphone,5,"It's ten years since the iPhone was first unveiled and Apple has marked the occasion with a new iPhone that doesn't just jump one generation, it jumps several. Apple has leapt straight from iPhone 7 (via the iPhone 8, reviewed here) all the way to iPhone 10 (yes, that's how you are supposed to say it).",influenster
iphone,5,"I absolutely love my iPhone X! The camera on this thing is beyond amazing, especially using portrait mode, the pictures come out looking professionally taken. The face recognition is probably my favorite feature; because i loved Touch ID but adding the face recognition made it that much more amazing and convenient. I’ve always been an apple fan; but this is literally my most favorite iPhone I’ve ever owned. 1000000% recommend!",influenster
iphone,5,I absolutely love my new  Apple iPhone X ! It's the perfect size even with my little hands. We all know new phones are expensive and this one was a little more pricey but you get so much for your money. The phone took a couple days to get use to but in our world any questions I had about the phone were easily answered on a simple google search. I highly recommend it to any and all of my friends and family!,influenster
iphone,5,"I love my iPhone. Once you go apple, it’s hard to go to Android. The connectivity is just so helpful and useful. The camera quality of the X is awesome and the functions/features are great. At first, it was difficult to use the phone without the home button, but it’s definitely easy to get used to!",influenster
iphone,5,My iPhone 6s recently got water damage so I needed to upgrade. I chose to go with the iPhone X because I really liked the fact that it had a larger screen without being the plus. I got used to not having the home screen button pretty quickly!! Love this phone.,influenster
iphone,5,Really good phone. My friend has a phone like this and I fell in love with it. Has good quality camera and it has cool little hacks to it. I also love how big it is. But i kind of dis like that it doesn’t have a jack to it because if u don’t have Bluetooth headphones and you need a jack u need to carry another product to just use ur headphones but overall I love it and can over look the no jack thing.,influenster
iphone,5,"Apple’s iPhone X has a big, beautiful screen, one of the best camera systems you’ll find on a smartphone, fast performance, and wireless charging. Features like the Face ID facial recognition system, used primarily for unlocking the phone and authenticating in apps, genuinely change the way you interact with and use the phone—usually for the better. It’s Apple’s best and most forward-looking iPhone",influenster
iphone,5,"Pros: The face recognition works perfectly, it's a nice size, has a beautiful screen with lovely rich colours, everything works as it should. It has an amazing battery life, with super fast charging. The sound quality from the speakers on the phone is excellent.Cons: No jack port",influenster
iphone,4,"I think this might be my favorite iPhone so far. I like how sleek it looks, the camera is great, the battery lasts a very long time and the face detection is super helpful. I don't like how the back is glass though, because it just ups my chances of it cracking during a fall. I like that they took out the home button; I can't imagine ever going back to having to using a home button.",influenster
iphone,5,My # GiftCrush this season is the IPhone X! If you’re a person who is in love with electronics and always wanting the newest best products this is the perfect gift to get someone like a significant other. This phone is a little pricey but it’s because the phone is designed and perfected to work flawlessly for personal and business use! What’s your #GiftCrush this season?! #Influenster,influenster
iphone,5,"By far, my favorite iPhone to date. The screen size is amazing, while keeping the body of the phone similar to that of an iPhone 8 (not Plus model). The $1000 cost might be out of the price range of some people, but is well worth the price tag. Battery life is astounding, the OLED is bright and vibrant, both the front and rear facing cameras are among the best in the industry.",influenster
iphone,4,"I have a love hate relationship with this phone. When in perfect lighting conditions it can take amazing photos. But normal every day pictures of my kids being kids, are just a blur! It’s like it can’t focus! My iPhone 5c took better indoor pictures lol. Ill add a photo I took with it in portrait mode :)",influenster
iphone,5,"The camera quality is splendid. Although, U miss the home button and the 4.7 size. For my petite hands that was the most convenient size. I think it has an improved bisyals, audio and battery time too.",influenster
iphone,5,"I am IN LOVE with my phone. I upgraded from the iPhone 6. It took very little time to get used to all the new features but now I can't think of a reason that a home ""Button"" was ever needed. I have the white one and it looks like a off white/greyish tone which I love SO much, I didn't really want it to be a BRIGHT white. Still on the hunt for a perfect case to go on it... it feels and looks so elegant as is!",influenster
iphone,5,"I really enjoy my X. I thought it would be difficult to get use to the no home screen, but it was fairly easy to get adjusted to. My mom and my brother also did really well adapting to the change too on their own phones. My mom is no techie but she did REALLY well for the knowledge about phones. It’s easy to learn the new functions and the picture quality is amazing.",influenster
iphone,4,"This phone was everywhere when it first launched, and for good reason too. I mean the price is kinda up there, but they're so techy and nice to use. The animoji feature is so fun. The face recognition to unlock is so easy. At first it was hard to transition over but once you get used to it. It's such a wonderful phone, it takes such nice pictures as well.",influenster
iphone,5,"Just got this baddie for Mother’s Day and can I just say wow, the screen is beautiful and it all just flows so wonderfully I can’t get over how great this phone is. I will say that you should invest in a good glass screen protector and case because this thing is all glass so that’s kinda scary.",influenster
iphone,5,"I actually have the XS, which I upgraded to when my 6s tragically died a watery death. I love love LOVE this phone! The camera is my favorite feature since I do a lot of work on social media. The missing home button didn’t take long to get used to at all.",influenster
iphone,5,"I love a phone that fits in my small hands and I never upgrade to just get the new best thing. So this was a first...I upgraded just to upgrade. I am not disappointed. The facial recognition is intuitive and fast, camera is upgraded with amazing portrait options and 4K video is a reality. I am just getting into the features but if you are charging me 1200 for a phone, when I could buy a new laptop, it had better live up to expectations and then go beyond. So far my fav feature is the enlarged screen and intuitive lighting. Believe it or not, I can now browse my phone as it dims itself when putting the baby to bed without him getting distracted. Mom win!",influenster
iphone,5,"Apple is life! The products are so user friendly, and the camera is amazing! Apple has created yet another great product. I do feel like since the Apple X is $1000 it should come with the AirPods.",influenster
iphone,5,"I love my iPhone X. It feels like a bigger phone that still fits in my hand. The swipe and face features allow for such fast use, switching between screens and such. There are way less bugs in the iPhone X than Iâ€™ve gotten in previous iPhones. And the camera is amazing. I love this phone.",influenster
iphone,5,"I am absolutely in love with this phone. The picture quality is great, and I love the 256GB storage option. As someone who keeps a lot of pictures and makes slideshows and minimovies, it definitely comes in handy! It took a while to get used to not having a home button, but after about three days, I didn't even really notice.",influenster
iphone,5,At first I was sad to go to the X cause it meant no more home button. But then I got over it and have never looked back. I enjoy how fast and easy everything it compared to having a home button. Iâ€™ve only had my phone since August but Iâ€™m satisfied for the time being. Donâ€™t really see the point in the xr or whatever the newer series are called.,influenster
iphone,5,I donâ€™t own this myself but it seems like an awesome product! My friends have it & I really really want it! It has an upgraded camera from what I know & I currently only have the iPhone 7! So I donâ€™t even have portrait mode!,influenster
iphone,5,Very easy to use! Sleek and the features are amazing. It is worth the high price tag. I love the camera  Apple iPhone X t fits easy in my pocket and purse or even a clutch. I had the iPhone 7 Plus but sometimes it was too big,influenster
iphone,5,"By far the greatest iPhone ever invented! Sleek, smart and sexy (until the new ones come out tomorrow - Apple Keynote!) I did however changed the device twice because my battery was draining pretty bad considering itâ€™s a brand new phone. Apple staff were super quick to fix it! All I can say is that I cannot live without this phone else Iâ€™d be writing reviews on papers (which isnâ€™t too bad!)",influenster
iphone,4,This holiday season I wish to get the new iPhone X! I've been wanting a new phone for a while now and hope my family gets it for me! Apple products are personally very easy to use and I say this because I've tried other cellphones besides Apple. I just love the easy navigation through apple and the way its system work! Apple iPhone X,influenster
iphone,5,Itâ€™s definitely a good phone. Definitely in my top 5. The screen is very fragile so be careful with it and PLEASE donâ€™t be that person that doesnâ€™t get a case and a temper glass because you think youâ€™re not gonna break it ðŸ˜‚ cause you WILL.ZAGG - InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for AppleÂ® iPhoneÂ® 6 Plus and 6s Plus - Clear,influenster
iphone,5,"LOVE it so much more than my old iPhone 7+!!! The feel and aesthetic is just so premium and luxe, I got one for myself and one for my best friend. We both love recording and taking pictures at concerts or for whatever haha. I am super impressed by how they perform and how quickly it is to adjust to the new features and or differences.",influenster
iphone,4,The Apple iPhone X can do so many cool things! It unlocks by face recognition and is so easy to use once you get the hang of it! it's on the expensive side i think it's $31 a month plus other fees and packages. but one thing that bothers me is once or twice it shuts off and doesn't turn back on until an hour later or so.,influenster
iphone,5,"First of all the camera on this product is amazing! The video is so high quality! It you want to vlog on it your footage would be perfect, your instagram pictures will be on fleek, and your snapchats will be popping. But the camera isn't the only good feature in the phone there are many more I totally recommend it to everyone.",influenster
iphone,5,"Got this phone after my 5s so def an upgrade. Its not hard to adjust to the size or the fact that there’s not a home button. Personally I love the screen! It’s super long and the resolution is great. I was considering the iPhone 8 before purchasing this one, but I’m soooooo satisfied with the ten! I’m glad I didn’t get the 8!",influenster
iphone,4,Recently purchased the iPhone XS and am very satisfied with the outcome. It’s a great phone and extremely fast. Only problems I have are pet peeves. Like Face ID not working in landscape mode and the batter percentage not being shown until you go to the command center. Other than that it’s a great phone and I would recommend.,influenster
iphone,5,I LOVE my X. it has been perfect for me since day one. I have a little girl who likes to play with my phone and it really hasn’t had any issues. iphones are always expensive BUT totally worth it in my opinion !,influenster
iphone,5,"I like the phone, I know that people say that it glitch’s but it works just fine. I’ve had the phone x for almost a year and i can say that it hasn’t glitch on me. Only when there was a software update. Over all I recommend you get this phone. I know it’s costs a lot but it’s worth it. So I recommend you get this phone.",influenster
iphone,5,Love my IphoneX! Such a unique phone that feels so great in your hand - the phone itself is so beautiful and really is just seamless - the phone has exceeded my expectations and would recommend anyone thinking about getting it making the jump!,influenster
iphone,5,"I love this phone. It’s smaller than my 6 plus. It was pricey but I got it anyway. I wish they would’ve kept the storage choices the same. Eliminating the 64g was not the best decision. I wouldn’t have released the 8 at the same time either. Not the best decision. I love the phone and I am an Apple everything person. MacBook, iPhones, iPads, etc.",influenster
iphone,5,The iPhone X is so user friendly and worth the expense. It is very reliable and the camera takes drastically clearer pictures. I like not having a home button. It eliminates the possibility it could become damaged or stuck. I also like that the screen encompasses the entire phone front. I would highly recommend!,influenster
iphone,5,"For all those I phone lovers our there, you absolutely need to invest in this phone! The batter life is significantly better and the wider screen is an added plus. This phone is waterproof and my favorite feature is the portrait mode on the camera. It literally looks like a professional photograph. Love this phone!",influenster
iphone,5,I love my iPhone X. This was my valentines day gift from my husband and I love it so much. The camera is incredible and It's too much easier to use with the new and amazing features. I love the better and improved face recognition its works great each time. This has got to be my best phone yet. I love it,influenster
iphone,5,What an amazing phone! I just upgraded from an IPhone 7 to and X and it has me floored. It’s a beautiful design and absolutely wonderful screen clarity! The price was steep but I would say it was worth it. So sleek.,influenster
iphone,5,"Absolutely in love with my new iPhone X. I do not like the price tag, but the features, speed, camera functions are amazing.! i love that it is small like an iPhone 7, yet the screen is that of an iPhone 7 Plus. The sideways cam is too cool with the dual functionality. It does get some getting used to just because the gestures are different and no longer a home button. But more phones now a days no longer have physical button so might as well jump on the band wagon:)",influenster
iphone,5,I'm too excited to get my hands on the news iphone X. Getting it for free that comes with my telecom plan. The 256gb is currently out of stock and I am on waiting list. Hope to get it very soon. I just can't wait! Apple iPhone X I'll will be reviewing the iphone x as soon as I get it.,influenster
iphone,5,I never had this phone before but I would rate this phone full stars because my friend has it and the camera is great. it is reliable and I wish I had it. in my opinion the best feature is everything. I would recommend this to other people if I had it myself. Also this phone can help me with school.,influenster
iphone,5,"I've had iPhones for several years now and have had the X for almost a year.  I love it, but I'll be honest I definitely dont use it to its full potential.  I forget half the things it does sometimes and end up still using it for the basic functions of internet, phone & texting.",influenster
iphone,5,GREAT PHONE! Amazing capabilities and camera. Portrait mode rocks. Makes taking photos more enjoyable now that the quality is higher and more professional. This phone is great! Can’t wait to upgrade to the MAX.,influenster
iphone,5,I just want to say a couple things. Yes Apple will always own the fact that they don’t build the experience around cool new features or technology but they definitely design the experience FIRST and then decide what technology to achieve the result. THIS phone brings great features to the hands of the user in such an intuitive way it was almost hard for me to notice what is new.,influenster
iphone,5,"I’ve had this phone for a week now and I love it. I was die hard Android couldn’t stand apple products and serious about it. My phone broke last week and the only thing on stock was apple. I figured if I was going apple I was going all the way. I love the screen, colors, and the camera.",influenster
iphone,4,"To be honest, I don’t like the face recognition as much as I liked the fingerprint. The camera is great, but it drives me crazy that you have to download an app to take a photo large enough to fill the screen. The resolution is great, but the size is the issue I struggle with.",influenster
iphone,5,"The iPhone X has been a great upgrade for me. The Face ID is quickly, response, and offers a great level of security for the phone and secure apps. There is a slight learning curve to the new gestures on the phone, but they end up becoming very natural. You’ll forget about the home button very quickly.",influenster

iphone,5,I just bought the 256GB iPhone Xs in Gold and I am loving it! I upgraded from a 16GB iPhone 6s so the processing is amazingly fast in comparison. Face ID and no home button has been so easy to get used to surprisingly.,influenster
iphone,5,I had this phone since December I love it the face ID is a little difficult sometimes but other than that I really love the phone. I would recommend people who are very tech savvy to but the iphone X.,influenster
iphone,5,I love my new iPhone X it is way better than the other iPhones out now I would not be able to go back to the old one because the iPhone X is more advanced.  The phone also Thales amazing pictures. Apple iPhone X,influenster
iphone,5,Absolutely love APPLE PRODUCTS! I currently have the IPhone X and it has been through so much! Iâ€™ve dropped it multiple times no cracks on the screen! My son also put my phone in the dogs water bowl for a good 20 seconds fully submerged & it still works! I love my IPhone X! :) <3,influenster
iphone,4,I absolutely love this phone. I am a long time apple user and this phone is my favorite yet! I love that there are less buttons and it is almost bezel-less. I was worried about the Face ID as someone who wears contacts and glasses but it recognizes me no matter what.,influenster
iphone,5,"Honestly, the best phone ever! Love love love portrait mode! Very easy to use, light weight and if youâ€™re not a fan of the plus size - but still want a good phone get this one! I encourage everyone to have it!",influenster
iphone,5,Iâ€™m not sure why everyone was so against the X. I get that itâ€™s super pricey but that aside its amazing. Iâ€™ve had mine since they came out and I love it so much. The camera is definitely my favorite part!,influenster
iphone,5,"I love my iPhone X, its full screen and does the face unlock. Camera quality is the best. I am my very own photographer. Price is high on these phones but I know its worth it. I've never had a problem with any of my Apple products! You will LOVEEEE!!!!!!!",influenster
iphone,5,I love Apple so much. I have never had Samsung or Android. No judgement against them but Apple is my favorite. I love the glass back and the double vertical camera. While  the X/10 is expensive it is totally worth it. Amazing phone and I love mine.,influenster
iphone,5,"i didn’t think i would like this phone coming from a 7+ because it’s smaller. however the size is perfect for your hands! a little expensive, but the camera on this thing is better than my DSLR... so if you like to take photos & your on the fence GET IT!",influenster
iphone,3,Personally I wouldn’t recommend specially not for 1000 does everything any other phone could do for way less.🤷🏻‍♀️ luckily camera is still one of the best overall apple give me something someone hasn’t already done Wouldn’t recommend to a friend,influenster
iphone,5,Very addicting phone. You never want to put it down. The facial recognition is extremely convenient and easy to get used to. It doesn’t feel as heavy as it looks either. Small enough to fit in your back pocket snug and beautiful camera quality.,influenster
iphone,5,"Absolutely in love with the bigger screen, camera, and new ios features. I recently switched from android to apple so I don’t know how the x compares to say the 8 or a 7, but my apps run much smoother and I’m impressed by the length of battery.",influenster
iphone,5,Just got this phone last week and it’s amazing! I love the emoji active feature and how there’s no home button! They also have so many new features locked into this phone. My battery lasts forever!!! I highly recommend even though it’s pricey!,influenster
iphone,5,I LOVE my iPhone X. It runs smoothly and the optics are perfection. Face ID is so convenient when I have dirty hands I don’t have to worry about my fingerprints not reading. It’s got a good steady weight to it and the camera is the absolutely best yet.,influenster
iphone,5,"The best iPhone that has come out this far! The camera is amazing and I love the Face ID aspect, it makes everything that much easier! I have doing the phone plan through Apple and got such a better deal in comparison to my Verizon carrier.",influenster
iphone,5,"I was torn between the X and the 8 for quite some time, but I'm so glad I went for the X! The battery life is great and I love all the new updates. I don't even miss the home button! I also don't have that many problems with the face ID",influenster
iphone,5,"I’ve been with the Apple family for awhile and this product exceeded my expectations. I made sure once they announced it to preorder ASAP. I love the convenience of Face ID, Animoji, Apple Pay, and etc. A great phone definitely worth the money. I have a review via YouTube of this product.",influenster
iphone,4,"I love the phone, but does have some issue even when I update it, such as an issue I am having right now which I have had in the past, I do not get notifications. I have tried everything to fix the issue and it still keeps happening.",influenster
iphone,5,I currently have this phone and I think itâ€™s the best iPhone that has ever been out it is so easy to do the things you love and the camera is amazing it is expensive but itâ€™s something you can splurge on and I think itâ€™s worth it,influenster
iphone,4,Great update from the iPhone 8! The camera is better than most digital cameras currently on the market. The larger screen makes it easier to read and video watching is seamless. The iOS system is fast and is completely intuitive.,influenster
iphone,5,"I love my iPhone X. I was concerned about missing the home button, but Iâ€™m pleased with how fluid they made the functions. The Face ID unlocks my phone much quicker than the thumbprint scanner. And the photo quality is amazing!",influenster
iphone,5,Really love this phone! I have had it for a while now and I keep finding out more and more things out about it that I love! My favorite part is the Face ID. I love that it is a really sleek design and looks supper high quality!,influenster
iphone,5,I rate this product a 5 because it has really good reviews and I really want one. I feel like the best feature on the iPhone X would be the new camera. This phone is a bit pricey for an iPhone but I feel like it may be worth it.,influenster
iphone,5,"I absolutely love this phone, I love the Face ID feature, the quality of the camera is amazing, love the portrait feature, the size of the phone is just right, not too big, not too small, itâ€™s very expensive but worthwhile.",influenster
iphone,5,"I have been in love with all Apple products for quite some time now, and this one doesnâ€™t disappoint! I love how it feels in my hand and how the screen takes up the whole front of the phone. It is pricey, but itâ€™s worth it.",influenster
iphone,5,I want to get this as gift for myself I need a phone  ðŸ“² I canâ€™t wait to get for myself ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ i just love apple products  Iâ€™ve seen all of review on it I canâ€™t wait to get for Christmas ðŸŽ„ does anyone else like the iPhone X ? #GiftCrush ðŸ“²ðŸ“²ðŸ“²ðŸ“²ðŸ“²ðŸ“²ðŸ“²ðŸ“²,influenster
iphone,5,I love my IPhone X!! The speed is amazing and I have plenty of storage on my on phone. The camera is way better then any previous models. I do believe the price tag is to heavy though.  Apple iPhone X,influenster
iphone,5,"I love my iPhone. First, it took me a while to get used to not having a home button, but it is great not having one. I love the camera so much and the battery lasts really long.  Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,5,I haven’t gotten this phone but I know others who have. The simple fact is the technology these days are so advanced and it’s fascinating that a phone unlocks to the face of the phones keeper. I hope that one day I can get one!,influenster
iphone,4,Okay. I am on the side of the Apple followers. But when it comes to this new iPhone I’m just not a huge fan. I don’t really like the fact that there’s no more home button. I prefer the older versions for sure!,influenster
iphone,5,"I love my IPhone X, for the longest time I wanted a bigger screen but hated how big the IPhone plus was and that I have small hands. I love that the iPhone X is the same size as the IPhone 8 but with a larger screen.",influenster
iphone,5,My husband recently bought this phone and it’s great. I like the new features and it takes perfect crisp clear pictures. I have the iPhone 7 and happy with it. I’m definitely going to upgrade come due time.,influenster
iphone,5,This phone is seriously incredible!! I upgraded from the iPhone 6s straight to this phone and I couldn’t be happier. I’ve wanted the Apple iPhone X ever since the rumors had started coming out and now I have it. The camera is absolutely incredible and I use it almost every day. The main reason I was in love with this phone is the look and the screen. The OLED display is so bright and clear especially compared to my old iPhone 6s. I don’t regret my purchase one bit and I am extremely happy to have gotten this phone. Its the perfect fit for my hand and I don’t sacrifice screen size for the overall size of the phone. I get the plus size screen with the phone size of a normal iPhone.,influenster
iphone,3,"I bought the Iphone X a couple months after it came@out and wasn’t fully happy with it, i’ve been an apple fan since the first one came out and this one to me was their worst.. slow, froze so many times",influenster
iphone,5,I LOVE the new look to the iPhone. I want one so bad. It’s so beautiful. I love how there’s no home button. The quality on the phones camera is just out of this world. I would recommend this to others.,influenster
iphone,5,I’ve had the iPhone X for about 2 months now and absolutely love it! Finally Apple has come to the upgraded technology of today. I love the full touch screen and facial recognition features and the sound is so much louder than earlier models! The camera quality is amazing and it has really cool features hidden inside! I see many improvements going forward like removing the notch on the top or making larger models and even putting a fingerprint sensor on the touchscreen but that is for future models.,influenster
iphone,5,"Not only is this one of the coolest and best iPhone ever, but it is quiet expensive. Regardless of price, the iPhone X is amazing at photos, playing games, and doing internet browsing on a big screen.",influenster
iphone,5,"This phone its self is amazing my dad has it and  I love it , I try to get on it every chance I get I  love love LOVE the phone its amazing the way it looks and the way it takes pictures it is so nice and amazing I love it ITS TO DIE FOR I WOULD TREADE IT IN FOR ANYTHING",influenster
iphone,5,I love my iPhone X! It was a little pricey but totally worth all of the convenience features! I love the face recognition. Face recognition is even used when accessing my credit cards or auto filling my passwords.,influenster
iphone,5,I would love to get this. I love that it is slightly smaller than my iPhone 7plus yet the screen is bigger. Itâ€™s amazing. I also love the face unlock feature. I canâ€™t wait to be able to charge my phone wirelessly.,influenster
iphone,5,I actually Iâ€™m new to iPhone Shocker! So my first new real iPhone is the iPhone XR I got the coral one and Iâ€™m pleasantly pleased and surprised how easy and fast it was to get it up and running.,influenster
iphone,5,Amazing product apple created here. The picture resolution is amazing so you donâ€™t even need a professional camera which makes your life less expensive. Easy to use at any age. Highly recommend,influenster
iphone,5,"This is actually my favorite phone that apple has came up with! I bought me and my boyfriend one and we canâ€™t live without it. Itâ€™s great, durable and water proof! Everything you can ask for!",influenster
iphone,4,"I love my iPhone X, however I do find that the changes to the iOS system and the changes to how you open and close apps, or how you screenshot differently do take some time to get used too.",influenster
iphone,5,I love my iPhone X. Took some getting use to without having a home button but I love it. The camera quality is amazing ðŸ˜» and the new picture functions help capture those perfect memories!,influenster
iphone,5,I really love my iPhone X. At first I was unsure of all the different changes because of not having a button anymore but I have no issues! I got it when it was fairly new still and I did have a few issues getting out of particular apps but the update has fixed that already! I love that it recognizes my face to get into password protected apps and websites! Itâ€™s so handy and it keeps my security when Iâ€™m not near my phone so no one can read my notifications! Itâ€™s super fast and the camera is honestly better than my dslr sometimes!!! I love it!,influenster
iphone,5,I would love to review this product and give detailed information about the product. I've heard so many good things about this phone and would like to talk more in depth about it,influenster
iphone,5,I love my iPhone X. The most important thing for me to love was the camera and itâ€™s exceptional. I use many cameras at my disposal and Iâ€™m glad my phone camera is amazing.,influenster
iphone,5,"I love i phones thru  make my busy life easier. I love,the,color. Even though I do not own an i phone I would most definently love to have this one.  Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,5,I really need a new iPhone and this is perfect for a new iPhone present for myself and this is the new phone that I always wanted and this phone so good and I love this phone and wanted to use this for things that are important!,influenster
iphone,5,"Like all Apple products this is wonderful. An unparalleled design, elegant, practical, simple but beautiful. The potential of this intelligent slide makes it the best #GiftCrush for this Christmas.",influenster
iphone,5,"Itâ€™s alright, I like it more than other iPhones I have had in the passed but itâ€™s only upside is better speakers and the pled display, all other features are the same as all the other phones",influenster
iphone,5,"Have had my iPhone X since January and I absolutely LOVE it! The camera quality is amazing, so many beautiful photos with portrait mode as well! Definitely recommend ðŸ˜Š",influenster
iphone,5,Ok so I was skeptical at first with the new Face ID and the screen change.  Iâ€™m a die hard Apple fan and I put off getting the iPhone X because I wasnâ€™t too sure that I would care for it but Iâ€™m in love.  I love the new portrait editing that it has and it takes amazing video and photos.  I love the comfort of holding in my hand.  I think the plus was just slightly too big and I found that I dropped my phone frequently.  This phone fits nicely in my hand.  The quality of video (watching) is much better than the previous phones.  I tried the Face ID with my eye closed and it doesnâ€™t unlock.  Iâ€™ve tried it on my kids too whom do have a resemblance to me and it doesnâ€™t unlock for them either.  All in all I have to say itâ€™s a great phone and Iâ€™m glad I made the upgrade.,influenster
iphone,5,"This is such a great new device for anybody who is willing to learn new features and gestures to get the most out of technology. The design is so sleek and gorgeous too! It's similar to the 8, but with a better camera",influenster
iphone,5,"Best iPhone ever!!! Yo tenÃ­a el iPhone 7p y se lo terminÃ© regalando a mi esposo porque era muy grande y sentÃ­a que la tecnologÃ­a no era muy adelantada, ademÃ¡s de q solo tenÃ­a 32g de memoriaðŸ˜‘. Tuve un tiempo con el galaxy 8, no es un mal telÃ©fono pero cuando vi la cÃ¡mara y la calidad de las fotos decidÃ­ volver a Apple y no me arrepiento. Tengo el ecosistema completa y para grabar mis tutoriales, fotos de mis maquillajes ect es lo mejor.",influenster
iphone,5,"I am one of those donâ€™t fix it if it ainâ€™t broken type of people so Iâ€™ve been holding on to my Apple iPhone 6s Plus without upgrading because it did its job. It took a crap a few months ago so I finally upgraded to the Apple iPhone X. I am so glad I waited to upgrade to this one because itâ€™s amazing! The screen is just about as big as my Plus was with the edge to edge screen, but the phone itself is smaller so it actually fits in my pockets. The camera quality is beyond superb and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever need a regular camera again. Itâ€™s so multi functional that it was definitely worth the hefty price tag. I highly recommend it for anyone needing an upgrade!",influenster
iphone,5,"Love this phone! The camera is amazing and the technology canâ€™t be topped.If youâ€™re looking for a new phone in the new year, this is it! Although, it is expensive... but worth it! I like to think about it as a personal investment.",influenster
iphone,4,"The product is very well adapted. I think that for it to be a 10 year anniversary device, Apple really outdid themselves. Affordability was a tad unattainable but if you can, it is very easy to use. I would definitely recommend the device to a friend. There are so many neat added features to this device, that have not been on previous devices, that make the iPhone X unlike the rest! Anyone looking for a new cellular device to exceed your games, internet or photography needs in life; the iPhone X is the way to go!",influenster
iphone,5,I love this phone so much.i have this phone right now and I think it’s amazing. It is very expensive but it’s worth it. It is very reliable.it takes longer to charge but oh doesn’t run out of battery easily.,influenster
iphone,5,Hello I came according your product and I wanted to see if this product is as great as it says! I want to test and promote this product for everyone! Please let me test and review,influenster
iphone,5,"I looooove my new IPhone X! It honestly is the best phone I’ve had in gosh.... uh EVER!? Yeah. It has so many cool feature on it. It’s not too big and it’s not too small. It’s a big larger than the 8 but smaller than the plus sizes. The camera is absolutely incredible and has a portrait mode setting that makes it seems like you’ve suddenly become a professional photographer overnight 😜 I don’t mind. It have the home button, you get used too it! Love this phone so much! Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,4,"I like this phone very much! It’s a very advanced piece of technology. I love the photos it takes, the Animojis endlessly entertain me, and I find that some of the tools and features are very useful. The one thing that I don’t like so much on it is that every time I want to open my phone, I have to look at it (which really does sound lazy, but I just don’t like waiting for it to recognize me). Other than that though, I highly recommend getting it if you’re into this new technology.",influenster
iphone,5,"This phone is amazing!! It takes the BEST photos. You can rely on this phone to take amazing pictures!! When you first get the phone, it's pretty confusing but you'll get the hang of it. I totally recommend getting this phone!! #iphonex #phone #amazing  #techie",influenster
iphone,4,This phone is pretty snazzy 😂 The camera quality is so clear😍😍 And btw face I'd is nothing new😂 they just have way better face id😂 the battery is decent and the display is amazing 😍 it should be more affordable though 😂 but overall an amazing phone 👏👏👏,influenster
iphone,4,I HADDDDD to have this phone! I mean I get every phone!!! I should have gotten then 8 instead! I mean don’t get me wrong the phone good....NOT WORTH The price but good! I could do without the Face ID..I need my fingerprint back! Back camera is AMAZING...front camera not so much! screen is great!! That’s one feature that I love!! And the phone is too small!! Coming from an Plus to a...idk what to call this! I always use autocorrect 🤣🤣🤣,influenster
iphone,5,"For starters, look at these photos. This camera is to die for! The focus is incredible! I love this phone so much! It’s the best! It took a second to adjust to the new controls but so far, no complaints at all! Why? Because it’s Apple and they’re the greatest!",influenster
iphone,5,"This phone is amazing! I recently upgraded from an iPhone 6S plus and I’m so happy I did! The camera is awesome, the speakers are LOUD, and the graphics are sweet. There’s lots of cool little features also. It’s on the more expensive side but overall it’s a great phone for the price!",influenster
iphone,5,"I love this phone so much. I woke up at 1:50am to preorder this phone and I waited in line the day it came out. I have yet to have an issue with this phone. It has a great camera, screen resolution and let’s not mention Face ID. I would recommend this to anyone, even you Android users.",influenster
iphone,5,"Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone X sets a new gold standard for the next decade of iPhones. Coming hot on the heels of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus the iPhone X steals the show despite sharing nearly identical internal hardware. The X (pronounced “ten”) is a beautiful, modern sculpture, and iPhone owners finally have a reason to show off their phones again.",influenster
iphone,4,I am a die hard iPhone user. I started with the iPhone 4 and have been hooked ever since. I recently upgraded to the iPhone X. I have the iPhone forever plan through Sprint. I love the ease of use and the options to send payments through text messages. My only complaint is that the screen is extremely fragile. Within a day of receiving the phone I noticed a hairline scratch.,influenster
iphone,5,I have had this phone for a month now and i must say that it is my favorite iPhone ever !!! I loved the size of my plus but where the screen is the same size i don’t notice a huge difference and i think I like the overall size of this phone better. I think it’s a very professional and adult looking phone as well. The camera is great and i love not having a home button !!!,influenster
iphone,5,"I would love to get an Iphone so badly. I believe that this phone would be a huge step up from the phone that I have. If you're thinking about getting someone a new phone as a gift, then you should definetly get this product. It is literally the best phone of the year. If I could get one, I know I would get this one without a doubt. Go Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,5,In one word the most amazing phone ever. So first things first the phone unlocks with your face and another person won’t be able to see your notifications unless you show your phone your face. The design is extraordinary and very beautiful and best feature of it is the Animoji.,influenster
iphone,3,"So, my boyfriend has this phone and of course I spent a few days consumed with it and seeing all of its new features. Needless to say, a lot of impressive upgrades. But, I can't get over the fact that there isn't a home button. Whatever Apple does next, they should include a button somewhere.",influenster
iphone,5,I’m a huge fan of Apple and all of their products. I started out with Apple before they even had the iPod Touch and I’ve stuck with them since then. I currently have the iPhone X and it’s fantastic. The facial ID works better than I imagined and not having a home button hasn’t been a problem. It’s a lot of money but great to have.,influenster
iphone,5,"When I first got this phone, I was disappointed in the size. To be honest, I thought my 7 Plus was better and I would wish I kept it. The more I used it and realized all the features it has, I began using the phone to its potential. Now, I can't go back to any phone with the exception of the new iPhone X + (plus) lol.. :)",influenster
iphone,5,I love this phone. I have had and iPhone since I don't know how long and they have later. My iPhone x has a wonderful camera quality and is amazing. I highly recommend for anyone because it is very easy to use and I just love it so so much.,influenster
iphone,5,So far this phone is really good. I like the updated screen with crisp clear images and graphics. I like how the camera is and gives more features and the memory they have on this phone is a step up then the older iPhones. I also like how it is different in technology. But again the price is a tad more then the older iPhones,influenster
iphone,5,"Jumped from the iPhone 6s to the iPhone X and I am in love. The camera is just amazingly amazing, the phone is very slim so easy to fit inside my purse and there is so much space!! I love everything about the phone, from the screen to the way the apps are displayed to the face recognition ID. Perfect, highly recommend.",influenster
iphone,5,When my original phone was acting up I was debating on the 8 or the x. I went to apple and started playing around with them and I fell in love with the x. It’s easier to use then I thought the camera is amazing and it’s the perfect size. If you are tired of your phone and are looking to get this would I recommend it 100%,influenster
iphone,5,Received this item on launch day and I haven’t had any issues with this phone. My favorite part about the phone is the facial recognition. I was tired of using my fingerprint for everything. I would totally recommend this phone.,influenster
iphone,4,I would love to have an IPhone X because I have had really good experiences with Apple in tge past and I just overall in general love apple and their design and apps and just everyrhing all about them. The only thing that I dont like is that its missing google and YouTube but you can easily just download those on there,influenster
iphone,5,"I would definitely recommend buying it! If you are interested in it you can get it at the nearest Apple store! It has tons of new features such as Animoji and exclusive backgrounds! I personally think that it is better than the Samsung phones! Again, I totally recommend buying it no doubt!Apple iPhone X😊",influenster
iphone,5,"I’m really liking the iPhone X. The face recognition function is pretty neat and convenient. At first it wasn’t easy to adjust to not having a middle button but after a week, I no longer missed it. There’s not too many changes but I do like that it’s much smaller and thinner than the iPhone 7 Plus.",influenster
iphone,5,"This thing looks amzing!!! I really wanna try it out, so i could tell everyone how great it is, and make them buy it.  This phone is just to exspensive for me, so sadly, i will never get my hands on it. On my yt channel, if i ever do get it (i doubt it), i would say al the great things.",influenster
iphone,5,"I really like the Apple products, and I am the person that is so excited about to be fashionable. I payed $1000 plus taxes, I think it is expensive but once again I was surprised by the photo quality that in my opinion the Apple is the best and now with the resistance that IPhone X has.",influenster
iphone,5,"i love my new phone so much! i know it's a bit pricey, but i promise it makes every dollar worth it. the face recognition is occasionally unreliable, but it is pretty cool and all my friends would agree. the camera quality is amazing and i wouldn't trade this phone for anything.",influenster
iphone,4,"I love my IPhone X, but I guess I got bad luck. Mine gets overheated just watching videos. It shuts down on its own and it’s a scratch magnet! On the other hand, it has a beautiful look, feel, and hardware. I do wish it came in gold. It has an amazing camera with fun features.",influenster
iphone,4,I love all my Apple products. The only downside I have to this phone is the battery life! I love that the screen is large. The facial recognition is great with very few times it doesn’t register my face. The home button was a challenge for me a few days but now it’s routine.,influenster
iphone,5,"I got the Iphone X as soon as it came out! BEST DECISION EVER!!! I love the face ID and being able to just look at the screen to make purchases, etc. It took some getting used to since there is not a home button, but now I can't imagine going back to having a home button.",influenster
iphone,5,I love apple products and i bought this phone becuase i needed an upgrade and this phone is the best it hold so much memories i love the quality of the camera it takes the best pictures and videos,influenster
iphone,5,The best thing of this iPhone is the portrait mode of pictures. It can be a bit frustrating because face recognition is harder than it looks. It doesn’t verify that much at night or if its on a desk and you lean over the desk it will not recognize you. It literally needs to be in-front of your face.,influenster
iphone,4,"So I got this because my spouse raced on how great it was. Granted it has some cool features but the price is ridiculous. It has face recognition which is cool, but the phone itself is super slippery. The phone falls all the time so make sure you get a good case for it.",influenster
iphone,5,This is amazing. I upgraded to this one IPhone X. I used to have IPhone 7 Plus. And I got used to it. It meet my expectations and it’s absolutely fabulous. It doesn’t have any limitation. There is no need for anything in this phone than just rock and enjoy the features.,influenster
iphone,5,This is the best iPhone I have ever owed and I have owned everyone of them except for the 8  I highly recommend on getting the iPhone X or as other people call it the iPhone 10,influenster
iphone,5,"I am so happy with this phone, I gave my daughter my 7 plus and the size difference was weird to me at first but I actually really love it! It’s fast, I love the memory space, and the overall quality of the phone is great. I’m definitely IPhone for life 😍",influenster
iphone,5,At first I didn’t think I was gonna like this phone but I was wrong!! The price is high but yeah!! I love everything about it!! It’s easy to use not complicated no issues at all!! I would recommend if your an Apple user and can afford it!! Get one!!,influenster
iphone,5,Love this phone! The photo quality is amazing! I got the 256GB so I could have more room (even though I don’t need it lol). Still trying to get use to the no home button but definitely love this phone!,influenster
iphone,5,"I want this new iPhone so badly! Not only is the facial recognition top of the line, I love the fact that it comes with a charging pad instead of a physical charger! And who isn’t excited about the talking emoji ability?!",influenster
iphone,5,This is my all time favorite product. I will never find anything that compares to it. I would be so grateful if I could get PR packages of this product so I could review for the people on my social media pages! It would get you more sales! I can’t stress enough how much I love this product!,influenster
iphone,5,People complain about it having no home button and just has face recognition instead of fingerprint but honestly it's really better than any of previous ones in my opinion. I like it.,influenster
iphone,5,"Best iPhone yet! I have had it for several months now and have nothing to complain about. Perfect size, tons of storage, super fast, amazing camera, and just COOL! I know it’s expensive but... it’s worth it.",influenster

iphone,5,I would like to say that I would love to have this phone so when you get into your phone you can get in your phone with your face. Yes it’s easy to use but you have to get a good case for it.yes it meet all of the requirements.yes others should buy the new phone.,influenster
iphone,4,"Just got my X for $400 off at Verizon on black Friday and I am over the moon about it.  The OLED screen really makes all the difference! I didn't think I would like Face ID, but it is convenient because it's so accurate - it can recognize me with and without makeup and glasses.  It's not that much bigger overall than a 6, which is what I switched from, but the screen is considerably larger.  This is a huge plus for me and I think it will be to other women with small hands!  I didn't want to get anything bigger because I have a feeling I would drop it all the time.  The camera is hands down the best feature on this phone.  Portrait mode works great, works well in low light, and makes pictures look professional.  I would get this while you can still get your hands on it at a discounted price, because it's already being discontinued by Apple in order for them to force you to pay for the XS in order to get the dual lens camera and OLED screen.  Would I pay $1000 for this? No way, but $500? Sure thing.",influenster
iphone,5,Best iPhone made!! I love that it’s easy to navigate. It’s sleek and a cute accessory for any fashionista.,influenster
iphone,5,I got this for my son for his birthday. He is very happy with it. He prefers apple over android products. I would recommend this.,influenster
iphone,5,"Amazing phone, once again an improvement on the last iPhone model that I had and was very happy with. The sound is much improved (louder & clearer speakers) and the face recognition is something that I don't know how  I will ever be able to live without in a phone now having had it- it's amazing. The camera is the big hit, it takes phenomenal photos with great editing options. The only downside is that as with all iPhones I've had, the screen is not too hard to crack so definitely invest in a good case and/or Sapphire glass or similar to cover it with. Note that this phone operates right to the very edges with regard to swiping actions and so forth so make sure that the protective case you choose allows for you to utilize that or it will be a bit frustrating at times. I have the Otterbox Pursuit & like it very much, the wrist strap comes in handy as well. Initially I had the Otterbox Defender which worked fine, but prefer the slimmer body, easier access to edges of screen and as mentioned, the wrist strap features of the Otterbox Pursuit. Back to the phone- an easy 5/5 stars! Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,5,I just got this phone as a Christmas gift and it is a GAME CHANGER!! It’s extremely easy to use. I thought the home button being gone would be problematic for me but it’s not at all! The facial recognition is great so I don’t have to type in my phone passcode every time. My favorite feature has gotta be the camera though. I’m obsessed with portrait mode for taking pictures of my little girl. With the combination of cool photo apps like Tintype or Vsco cam I can make great memories. 😍,influenster
iphone,4,"I bought this phone right when it was first released. it was very expensive, so I have been extremely careful to not crack my phone---as I would have to pay hefty consequences for doing so. I guess in my opinion, the photos have been great. I mainly use my phone for social media so it was important to me to make sure the product is fit for my necessities.",influenster

iphone,5,"I really do love this phone. I will admit, I do have a soft spot for apple, but I think apple blew it out of the park with this phone. The edge to edge display really makes the viewing experience amazing and Face ID is really accurate. One thing I do miss is the Touch ID, but if you had this phone for a while. You sorta forget that was even an option. The camera is amazing for photos and videos. It's very crisp and sometimes makes the picture even more beautiful than what it was in real life. I would definitely recommend this phone to everyone!",influenster
iphone,5,"The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, yet one that really paid off six months into our testing. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got.",influenster
iphone,5,"The iPhone X. Or the iPhone 10.

iphone,5,I think it’s worth the money. Great camera and great screen. Battery life isn’t amazing if you use your phone all the time but most phones are. There are older models which are also good if this is too pricey but I do recommend. Takes a while to get used to but it’s good.,influenster
iphone,5,"I was coming from an iPhone 6 Plus originally that just so happened to have screen damage the month I paid it off (typical) so instead of getting it repaired, I reverted back to my iPhone 5 (regular) and said I'd wait for the next release. Since the X was announced alongside the 8/8 Plus, I opted to wait even longer for the X and I'm glad I did. The look of the phone is top notch and the quality is definitely solid. Keep in mind I'm coming from something much older where the quality standards, while high at the time, pail in comparison to today's iPhone.I've had the iPhone X for six days now and don't even remember what using that Home button (that I've been using since the iPhone 3GS) is like. You'll forget it soon enough, too. The gestures are still very natural. I always hated how large the Plus model felt in my hands as doing anything ""one-handed"" was impossible, even using reachability. I feel that the X is a great balance between the non-Plus models and the Plus models and I did turn on reachability (it is turned off by default) to help reach some of the upper portions of the screen as I like using the phone one-handed.Next to my wife's iPhone 7 Plus, the screen size is virtually the same between the two, while the X's form factor is overall smaller, which is real nice. The ""notch"" along the top edge of the screen isn't an issue for me, as it seems to be for some. Within time, third-party apps will adopt the new resolution and everything will be seamless when switching applications. I have no qualms about the display's brightness either, as I find myself setting it to the lowest setting quite frequently. It's very bright! The only con I would give for the screen is that the refresh rate is lower than I expected, as I sometimes catch the screen flicker slightly with the naked eye as the oLED refreshes.I've never had Touch ID, so I cannot legitimately compare it to Face ID, but I can say that Face ID is very quick and intuitive. It was easy to setup and can be reset easily if desired. With Face ID, if there are notifications present and someone picks up your phone, they can only see what app is pushing the notification. The instance they hand the phone to you and you look at it, the specific notifications populate fully, which is nice if you're getting a text message that is for your eyes only. The only con (if you would call it that) I would give for Face ID is if your phone is sitting on a flat surface (such as a desk) and you're sitting next to it, your face is not within range of the sensor, so you have to either move into view/lift the phone into view, or enter the backup passcode to unlock the device.The speed is blazingly fast compared to my previous phones by far, while the battery life smashes any other iPhone I've had. I haven't charged it wirelessly so can't comment on that. I'll likely wait until Apple releases their own charging pad so I can use it with my Apple Watch. The sound output kinda blew me away too, as I've been finding myself turning it down, when I'm used to turning it up in the past. I don't care that they dropped the audio jack, as it's a wireless world we live in today. Thankfully for those of you who do require the audio jack, they include a Lightning to 3.5mm dongle adapter. As far as the camera, I was able to take amazing photos at a car show over the weekend, and the 4K video is stunningly crisp and smooth with it's dual stabilizing camera sensors. I'm in love with my phone again, and it's been awhile.The price I feel is fair in today's market. Yes, I paid $150 extra for the 256GB, but feel it's still very much worth the up-charge when the base only comes with 64GB. Photos, songs and videos add up quick, not to mention apps. The payment plan with your carrier makes it a little easier to swallow, and isn't much more than what my iPhone 6 Plus cost monthly back when it was new.I recommend Apple Care Protection, which can be purchased separately up to 60 days after original purchase date. Get a phone cover and screen protector on-the-double! Best Buy has many options available and I bought both a moderate, slimline cover and a durable, more bulky cover, as well as a glass screen protector. You'll want to protect this investment for sure.In short, if you've been holding out for three (or more) years like me, then this is definitely the iPhone you want to get. You will not be disappointed!",influenster
iphone,4,"It’s pretty good as iPhones go, not much different from older models the screen quality is very clear and good for watching videos, screen is big and easy to use and the Face ID is great and really works, the only thing I hate is the Apple Pay feature I much preferred the Touch ID function as it was so easy or using passcode but the double tap feature is pretty bad.",influenster
iphone,4,"I've had my iPhoneX for a few months now and honestly all the new features are amazing such as the face recognition, battery life, screen and camera, but there are some setbacks which i didn't expect, unlike other iphones in the past with this one in order to close an application you cant just swipe up like before you need to hold on the app and wait for an 'X' to show and then you close them one by one which is pretty frustrating, another setback is the lag it has. my phone suddenly just freezes and then turns off, and then i need to reopen the phone again. OH!! and last thing, the face recognition only recognizes you when you're sitting up straight so it needs a bit of an effort if you're just laying in bed, it's during these times where you start to miss your finger recognition.",influenster

iphone,5,"he iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, but one that really paid off. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got. The OLED display goes a long way in making amends for these quibbles. The 5.8-inch screen has a 2,436 x 1,125-pixel resolution (458 pixels per inch), and it’s razor sharp. Colors are vibrant, blacks are finally as pitch-dark as many other OLED Android phones, and it was easy to read in direct sunlight.  You’ll have a hard time pulling your eyes away from this screen. As on the iPhone 8 and iPad, Apple’s True Tone technology detects the lighting condition you’re in, and adjusts the screen’s tint to make it more readable. It works extremely well, and made the screen warmer — and easier on the eyes — in our harsh office lighting.The phone’s all-glass rear is almost the same as the iPhone 8 Plus, except the dual-camera setup has turned to a vertical orientation. Apple says the front-facing depth sensors and cameras took up a lot of space up top, and the rear camera wouldn’t fit sideways. With only the Apple and iPhone logo printed on the glass, the back looks minimal and sleek. The vertical orientation is a dead giveaway you have the iPhone X, as it’s a pretty unusual camera orientation and placement on a phone.One noticeable difference is the power button, which now perhaps should be called the “lock button.” Still situated on the right edge, it’s more elongated than before, which makes it easier to find and press. We say lock button because to turn off the iPhone X, you need to press the lock button and the volume up or down buttons. Tapping on the lock button just wakes or turns off your screen, but you can double tap it to activate Apple Pay, or press and hold it to launch Siri.The mute switch is on the top left, and the volume rocker sits below. There’s still no headphone jack, and the only port is for your Lightning cable at the bottom edge, between the bottom-firing speakers. For music, you’ll either have to pair wireless earbuds with the Bluetooth 5 technology on board, or you can embrace the dongle life with the included Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter.What I like most about the iPhone X is its size. It feels compact — it’s slightly larger than the 4.7-inch iPhone 8, but it has a bigger screen than the 5,5-inch iPhone 8 Plus. The X is comfortable in the hand, and it feels remarkable to have so much more screen real estate than a cumbersome “plus-sized” phone. Our Youtube Channel can be viewed at the following link.

iphone,5,"I’m so in love with this phone! All the little features such as FaceID, not showing a preview of a text unless it knows its you looking at the screen, not dimming when you are reading something and the sound quality is such a big difference alongside the brightness (I have mines just below half way now and it’s just as bright as my old iPhone when it was up full!). I also am a big lover of the True Tone setting, and don't get me started on the camera! It is so crisp and clean and takes wonderful photos, it’s like having my DSLR in my pocket! It only took me a day to get used to not having a home button and now when I’m on my iPod Touch (I use for music), I go to swipe up to open it as well!

I love the fact that everything works with Face ID especially when I don’t have the effort to constantly put in my passwords. I’d say the best thing about this phone is by far the camera.

The idea of the Face ID is not bad, I just think itâ€™s creepy that your phoneâ€™s watching you all the damn time. The screen is much bigger than a Plusâ€™, although the phone is smaller. If you canâ€™t decide which one to go for, Iâ€™d recommend you to buy the 8, because the camera is literally the same and everything else is pretty much the same.

iphone,5,"Apple deliberately saved its high-end features for the iPhone X and itâ€™s unlike anything itâ€™s released before.It has the largest screen of any iPhone, at 5.8in and it stretches from edge to edge like those seen on the Samsung Galaxy S8and Galaxy Note 8. This screen is Appleâ€™s first foray into OLED displays, too, and to fit the larger screen onto the device the home button has been ditched. Instead, thereâ€™s a 'notch' that houses the phoneâ€™s Face ID camera (more on which later). Youâ€™d imagine this might make the handset feel large, but by maximising screen size without increasing the size of the handset, the iPhone X feels smaller than the iPhone 8 Plus. In fact, itâ€™s closer in design and feel to the original iPhone than any of its recent predecessors.",influenster

iphone,4,"I havenâ€™t had an iPhone in forever, so when my previous phone, an android died out after a fatal fall, I decided to splurge on this. Iâ€™m happy and satisfied; however, I do feel there are better phones on market that cost much less. The camera MP itself is shit, but the way apple has set up the app and what you can do with the camera is superb. The battery lasts all day long and more. I do find it easier to game on androids and certain apps run smoother. However, if youâ€™re into only social media and selfies, this is an excellent phone. I love that the whole front is screen and the phone is made of glass. Colors are vivid on screen. It has many nice and useful features. It has a nice sleek look. Itâ€™s a good size for even my small hands to hold and take a selfie. If you tend to use earphones often, you may not like this phone as you can only connect the charger or the earphones at a time. I wish the buttons were all on one side only. The phone connects easily to car via Bluetooth. Iâ€™ve dropped this already and had no cracks on the phone, case, or glass screen protector.",influenster
iphone,5,"Ok, ok, ok I have many things to say but I will make a brief summary.Let's talk about the iPhone X, this is a very good high-end device, the camera is simply amazing, with it you can get professional photography results without the need to buy a camera, with your camera in addition to obtaining spectacular results when making a professional photo, you can capture the most beautiful and funny in a very peculiar way. Its large 5.8-inch screen offers the owner a great comfort when holding it, its rounded corners are so elegant and perfect. His design in a few words is simply ""Perfect"", a thing that I also liked a lot was that they made a phone resistant to dust and water. Its graphics are great, work excellent with the best games in 4K UHD, its HDR screen makes the colors have a sharpness and definition very good.

I hated texting or typing on my iPhone 7 as the keyboard went right to the bottom of the phone and I found that my thumb knuckles would really start to hurt as I had to really torque my thumbs down the screen to type while holding my phone.

I was going from a 6S to the X and was worried that it may be too much of a big change for me to get used to with it having no home button.After having the phone now for over a week, I am happy to say that I have been having a great experience with it so far. I had very little issues with switching to it. No problem at all with Face ID. The only thing I am not really a fan of is changing to app view and closing the apps out. I find it to be a bit of a time waster compared to how it was with a home button.One of my favourite features is the camera. I am really liking the quality of the photos, especially those that are taken in Portrait mode. I am very happy with this phone.",influenster

Face ID generally works fine.The bad The iPhone X is nearly certain to be replaced by a newer, better model in less than 3 months, but remains hella expensive in the meantime.

iphone,4,This is my first time ever owning an iPhone and I have found the transition from Android to IPhone has been easy. Iâ€™m in love with this phone especially the camera and recording capabilities and options. I have read about some issues with the phone and pray that I donâ€™t encounter them because the phone is a major financial investment. I have had it for two weeks now and it has frozen up on me which was scary and concerning but Iâ€™m not giving up on it yet. Hopefully that doesnâ€™t happen again because I love the phone!,influenster
iphone,5,"I recently upgraded from an iPhone 6 to the iPhone X. I absolutely love it! It took me a while to adjust to the home button and headphone jack being gone, but once I did, it was a breeze! The phone's processor is much faster, so it doesn't lag out. I LOVE how much better the camera quality is. The screen display is also much clearer with way better definition. And the battery life is a HUGE improvement... I only have to charge my phone every other day now instead of daily. The device itself is also very thin and lightweight. I have not used the face recognition feature yet, but I'm excited to try it out. So far I am very pleased with this phone, and I definitely would recommend it!",influenster

If anyone has even once used iphone im sure none of them will ever againg use any other phone. Nowadays the last model is Iphone X and for me, in this mobile is everything together.

The camera on the X is simply amazing with built-in optical image stabilization on both camera/focal lengths. The detail is crisp and sharp. This truly rivals a DLSR camera.

It meet my expectations 100% and I would totally want to buy it for myself. The best feature is the The Face ID that is so safe and security wise. I would totally recommend this product. Oh!

Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got. The OLED display goes a long way in making amends for these quibbles. The 5.8-inch screen has a 2,436 x 1,125-pixel resolution (458 pixels per inch), and it’s razor sharp. Colors are vibrant, blacks are finally as pitch-dark as many other OLED Android phones, and it was easy to read in direct sunlight.  You’ll have a hard time pulling your eyes away from this screen. As on the iPhone 8 and iPad, Apple’s True Tone technology detects the lighting condition you’re in, and adjusts the screen’s tint to make it more readable. It works extremely well, and made the screen warmer — and easier on the eyes — in our harsh office lighting.The phone’s all-glass rear is almost the same as the iPhone 8 Plus, except the dual-camera setup has turned to a vertical orientation. Apple says the front-facing depth sensors and cameras took up a lot of space up top, and the rear camera wouldn’t fit sideways. With only the Apple and iPhone logo printed on the glass, the back looks minimal and sleek. The vertical orientation is a dead giveaway you have the iPhone X, as it’s a pretty unusual camera orientation and placement on a phone.One noticeable difference is the power button, which now perhaps should be called the “lock button.” Still situated on the right edge, it’s more elongated than before, which makes it easier to find and press. We say lock button because to turn off the iPhone X, you need to press the lock button and the volume up or down buttons. Tapping on the lock button just wakes or turns off your screen, but you can double tap it to activate Apple Pay, or press and hold it to launch Siri.The mute switch is on the top left, and the volume rocker sits below. There’s still no headphone jack, and the only port is for your Lightning cable at the bottom edge, between the bottom-firing speakers. For music, you’ll either have to pair wireless earbuds with the Bluetooth 5 technology on board, or you can embrace the dongle life with the included Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter.What I like most about the iPhone X is its size. It feels compact — it’s slightly larger than the 4.7-inch iPhone 8, but it has a bigger screen than the 5,5-inch iPhone 8 Plus. The X is comfortable in the hand, and it feels remarkable to have so much more screen real estate than a cumbersome “plus-sized” phone.",influenster

iphone,5,"""What i love about the Iphone X is that it's not only suitable for normal day usage. But it also great for traveling. The functions are so detailed that you doesn't need to bring other heavy gadget along while traveling.  This is where i want to keep my most precious memories. With unlimited photos and videos of families, friends and places.My #GiftCrush that I'm hoping to get is the Iphone X. As you noticed that there a tonnes of a poaitive review about the latest Iphone. What with the Face Unlock System and others. But impacted me more to choose this phone is that, the quality of the camera. The images that its capture and the details of it. I love travelling. But what i hate the most is the bulky gadget that i need to bring along. Sometimes i spent half of my luggage for my camera stuff. The tripod, battery, the lense and even the camera itself is bigger than others. With this brand new iphone. Not only I bring along 1 items for all. It saves me a space on my luggage. It hassle free, no more hit someone else accidentally when bringing my big bulky tripod. I just bring my phone stand. And tadaaa. As simple as ABC.I want this Iphone so badly that I try surveyed it in my country. Unfortunately the price is a bit higher that i expected for a medium salary person like me. If only i can get this as a gift. It will make my whole years feel like dancing in the rain. ELATEDLY HAPPY",influenster

iphone,5,"The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, but one that really paid off. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got.it is a perfect phone buy it",influenster

iphone,5,"The iphone x launch was an incredibly risky one but Apple somehow made it successful. We all needed a change from the same boring looking gadgets and iphone x was just the right choice. Although expensive the latest iphone offers face id which enables animoji which is short for animated emoji, a fster processor and a better camera for all the techies out there. My experience with iphone x is kind of a mixed reaction where on one hand i love the features but on the other i hate taking my phone out in public in fear of flexing. The face id is kind of a fail cause my sister is sometimes able to open my phone even without knowing the passcode and the no earphones jack thing is annoying which brings me to my next point. The x has passed the drop test successfully without the glass body shattering entirely and the water test where it was submerged 20 ft down a river and still survived. Despite apple saying it can only survive 1m, it surpassed our expectations and went 6.67 m which is incredible. This technology gives us hope that in the future we can get our flying cars which we were promised a decade ago and that humanity is definitely evolving not reversing as whole.",influenster

iphone,5,"One of the most comfortable phone to use . If u r trying iPhone for the first time , I would not recommend this phone because it is hard to use at the start . Other than that this phone is stylish n very comfortable to use . It is easy to carry n it not that expensive .",influenster
iphone,4,"I bought this phone after my brand new 8 plus was stolen. I was not a fan at first which is why I did not choose it over my 8+ but the smaller size did grow on me. The lack of home button and face recognition took a bit to get used to but comes in handy especially when you're cooking and can't wipe your hands right away to unlock your phone. The screen delivers crisp and clear video quality that is like a dream. I use my phone a lot for drone flying and quick videos when I'm traveling without needing to carry a DSLR or other heavy equipment for about the same quality. Would not choose the XS over the X but if you're upgrading from below an 8, then the XS could be the phone for you.",influenster
iphone,5,"Let's talk about the iphone x, well this iphone has been a big breakthrough for the best phone company although its price is not cheap depends on the person if you would buy it because it is a phone that is very advanced and people could get there to think that it is not worth paying that price. But I would say that if it is worth paying because the phone has new features such as facial unlocking, emojis, the camera is super good and the design is super cute to the only thing that I do not get used to is that it does not have the button if not that it is with the finger all",influenster

iphone,4,"Got my iPhone X for 2 months now. Upgraded from 6 so I can definitely see the big difference in speed and quality. I had doubts before, wasn’t sure about lack of the button. However, I now love it. It really doesn’t metter that button is not there, I got use to it after a day and face recognition is very good as well. It may not recognise you if you wrap in scarf and hat, but generally it does a good job! It has some slower moments, but I think it’s mostly fault of the apps that weren’t properly updated for iPhone X yet, some of apps don’t work on iPhone X yeat.

The moment that you put your hands on it and you experience the screen, you will think it is worth every penny. I was lucky to be third in the store to pick it up and I have to say the staff at Apple today were better than any other time I've ever seen.The queue was mind-blowing. There were close to 300 people waiting and the store would only let a few of us in at a time.The BIGGEST thing I noticed was 3 customers while I was there asking if they could change from the Space Grey to the Silver because it looked so much better. It is simply just stunning. AHHHHHHHHHHHIf you guys have any questions you quickly want answered, let me know and I'll check for you.

iphone,4,"Apple iPhone XI love almost everything about this phone, but before I begin I must say that I do miss the home button. It’s on the pricey side but I must say I love apple products. The camera takes out really great pics, both front and back. The graphics is amazing. The overall finishing a on the iPhone X is really crisp and elegant.",influenster
iphone,5,"Apple has been coasting for too long with the design it introduced for the iPhone 6, but that all changes with the iPhone X – in a big way. You don’t need me to tell you the iPhone X is a huge departure from the iPhone design of old – just look at the pictures. Not only does it look good, however; Apple has done a fantastic job at actually making it feel really good too.  This phone is simply gorgeous. It’s slightly taller than the iphone 8 and 7 and 6 but much narrower and smaller than the iPhone 8 Plus. It strikes the perfect balance, especially since you’re getting a 5.8-inch display .The aluminium sides have been swapped out for stainless steel – as seen on the Apple Watch – and the front and rear of the device are glass. I received the Silver variant for review – and, unfortunately, it wasn’t long before it was covered in fingerprints, those shiny sides being a particular magnet. This is a phone that looks fantastic straight after a wipe-down; not so much a few hours after it’s been in your greasy palms.Also of concern is how the iPhone X will fare over time. No matter how unscientific they might be, drop tests indicate that the finish here doesn’t lend itself well to wear and tear. After all, the stainless steel Apple Watch I’ve been using is a scratched-up mess. As a result, my iPhone X has spent much of its time inside an Apple case, but this certainly sees it lose points in the glamour stakes.iPhone X 64GB – 15GB, £42pm, £250 upfront on O2 (use code TRUSTED10 to save £10)Alternatively,",influenster

iphone,5,"The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, but one that really paid off. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got.it is a perfect phone buy it",influenster

It also ships the new A11 Bionic processor as well as an enhanced dual 12 megapixel main camera module. The fingerprint sensor (Touch ID) gives way to facial recognition (Face ID). A great blend of handheld comfort and a big, gorgeous OLED screen. Rear telephoto camera outshoots the 8 More in low light, and the camera snaps impressive portrait selfies. Face ID generally works exellent and i hope to do a review fot this phone on my instagram account",influenster

iphone,5,"What i love about the Iphone X is that it's not only suitable for normal day usage. But it also great for traveling. The functions are so detailed that you doesn't need to bring other heavy gadget along while traveling.  This is where i want to keep my most precious memories. With unlimited photos and videos of families, friends and places.My #GiftCrush that I'm hoping to get is the Iphone X. As you noticed that there a tonnes of a poaitive review about the latest Iphone. What with the Face Unlock System and others. But impacted me more to choose this phone is that, the quality of the camera. The images that its capture and the details of it. I love travelling. But what i hate the most is the bulky gadget that i need to bring along. Sometimes i spent half of my luggage for my camera stuff. The tripod, battery, the lense and even the camera itself is bigger than others. With this brand new iphone. Not only I bring along 1 items for all. It saves me a space on my luggage. It hassle free, no more hit someone else accidentally when bringing my big bulky tripod. I just bring my phone stand. And tadaaa. As simple as ABC.I want this Iphone so badly that I try surveyed it in my country. Unfortunately the price is a bit higher that i expected for a medium salary person like me. If only i can get this as a gift. It will make my whole years feel like dancing in the rain. ELATEDLY HAPPY",influenster

iphone,5,"I had the first iPhone that was out years ago and I loved it. Thought I’d see what all of the android phones were like before getting another. Must admit, I still can’t fault them. They have to be the best phone out there as gadget wise. It’s improved a hell of a lot over time and it keeps me occupied all day long with the great apps that the App Store provides and all of the music too. Sound quality with out headset is fab!!! I hardly ever now use my Bluetooth speakers because the sound is so good. What I love about the features now, are the touch senses when you unlock your phone, it’s fab!!! Camera is great!!! Overall, iPhone is a winner for me, beats the others I’ve had in the past",influenster
iphone,4,"El famoso iPhone X un dispositivo revolucionario, en el que Apple a dado un gran salto pero, todo no es color de rosa, este dispositivo aun no esta optimizado, lo cual las apps de terceros aun no estan adaptadas a su pantalla y hacen un uso dificil, pero es un dispositivo muy potente, con el famoso Chip A11 bionic y una gran camara trasera y delantera con modo retrato en las dos, el famoso Animoji y su mantalla Super Retina.",influenster
iphone,4,"I’ve had the new iPhone X for around a month now and overall I’m pleased. The expectations surrounding this phone were extremely high so I was excited to finally get my hands on it. I love the new layout of the phone and the high quality of the camera. I love the Face ID - it works every time! I upgraded from a 6s therefore I have benefitted greatly from the iPhone X. However, I do wonder whether this phone is actually worth £1,000. I personally feel the price is too high. Furthermore, I was greatly disappointed that when watching YouTube videos the full screen does not get used - it gets cut to resemble an old iPhone screen. Nevertheless, overall I’m very happy with the iPhone X and have had no problems upon use.",influenster

iphone,5,"I know that I’m not the only one that likes apple products, but I know that I love them just as much as they do. I have the iPhone 7 right now and I love it so much. I have been an Apple fan ever since I got the iPod touch 4th generation. I’ve had the IPod touch, IPad mini 4, Mac Book Air, and IPhone SE before the iPhone 7. I’m the types of person that loves taking pictures. Every time I’m at my cottage I’m always taking pictures of the lake. I love the camera on this phone, it’s so clear. The size of the phone is nice but it’s a little too small for my hands. I’m was little upset that it doesn’t have the headphone jack but that didn’t stop me from buying it.  I have had this phone since August 13th 2017 (My Birthday) and won’t get a new phone till 2019. When my contract is up, I will be getting the newest phone that will come out. I used to have a Samsung Galaxy S5 before my SE and it was horrible, mine and my sisters kept crashing so we decided to go to Apple instead of Samsung",influenster
iphone,5,I was really happy with my Iphone X. I had an Iphone 6 before and 16 GB was not enough for my photos apps and videos now I have 64GB storage which is enough for me. The quality of the photos and videos are superb. It just take a little bit to figure how you can take a sreen shot and how to turn on and off your iphone X because it doesn’t have a home button. But overall I give it a 5!! :),influenster
iphone,5,"My dad has this phone and I honestly would love to have one myself.1. You get two colours black and silver so beautiful.2.

iphone,5,"omg ! what should i say ? oh god ! iphone x  it's amazing !! .. i hope that i could have it   I’m so in love with this phone! All the little features such as FaceID, not showing a preview of a text unless it knows its you looking at the screen, not dimming when you are reading something and the sound quality is such a big difference alongside the brightness (I have mines just below half way now and it’s just as bright as my old iPhone when it was up full!). I also am a big lover of the True Tone setting, and don't get me started on the camera",influenster
iphone,5,"Just got myself an upgrade from an iPhone 4! Loving the phone so far! Love the new features of the camera! “portrait stage light mono” fun to use and the shots come out professional looking. Animoji is super fun to use when texting with family & friends.

iphone,4,this is a good phone. comes with 3d face detection and animojis.it also have some great ar quality but it is not as per the rate. it costs 1000$ to buy this thing which is a little more.,influenster

I wasn’t used to the layout of that phone, and I think the iPhone has a very user friendly layout. My grandparents also have this iPhone and it is working well for them. I’ve had this phone for about a year and a half and is still working well for me. Love it! thanks",influenster

Amo esta marca ❤",influenster
iphone,5,"I love iphone . I upgraded from an S4. The camera and screen quality is amazing and the charging is really fast. It was expensive, but we were able to get a buy one/get one free and the only way cell phone carriers operate these days is to finance it over 2 years if you don't want to buy it outright, so the monthly payment for the 2 phones we got is affordable. I would highly recommend this phone. I am a Mac person for just about every other electronic I own, but I switched to Samsung/Android a little over 2 years ago and like them so much more than my iPhone. Every time I was upgrading my iPhone (I went through 3 models, loved my first) they seemed to have more and more glitches and it was very frustrating. I have not looked back since I switched! I was concerned with the Edge and potentially hitting it on accident, but I have not had that problem",influenster

The camera is absolutely stunning and the mechanism of the devise is just amazing. I just have to say that the price of this device might be a bit too high, so not everyone can afford this phone!",influenster

iphone,5,"I'd been waiting for the iPhone X for 2 years. My review follows this rant.2 years ago rumours started to circulate about this upcoming edge-to-edge fully glassed piece of art, which would be released on the iPhone's 10th anniversary. It would encompass the fastest processor, a 4k camera, 4k AMOLED screen, reality augmentation, new speakers, Face ID, In-screen Touch ID, and proximity wireless charging (a charging station that transmits a charge without contact).If the rumours held true this device would be the king of all Smart phones, no question.",influenster
