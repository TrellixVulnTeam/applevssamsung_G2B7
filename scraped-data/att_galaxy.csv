att.com,galaxy,"I absolutely love this phone. It's an upgrade from the Samsung Galaxy S6. The camera takes beautiful photos. I haven't gotten a chance to use the slow motion on the camera yet though. I would have given it 5 stars, but my phone keeps dinging (notifications) even though I have gone through all of the systems and turned off all notifications except text messages. The other thing that bugs me is, that they have changed the charging port size, and only included a USB adapter and 1 wall charger. So now none of my car chargers (or other wall chargers) will fit, so if I go anywhere I have to remember to also make sure to grab my only cord. It would've been much better if Samsung would've included an adapter, (not just a USB adapter). I also love the smaller size S9 as opposed to the S9+, as I have arthritic hands. (Is approx the same width as the S6, but a little longer (top to bottom) than the S6.",4
att.com,galaxy,This phone is great except that it doesn't have the mobile data quick setting like come on now this phone has so many great features and yet it doesn't have a easy and fast way to turn off my data ...apple has that why can't we,3
att.com,galaxy,"The Samsung S9 is a good phone. I like that even with a life proof cover it still will fit in my Carhartt thigh side pocket. One problem that I do have is the edge screen is difficult to click on somethings with the cover on it. But as expensive as the phone is I would not use it with out a cover. I seem to get better battery time with the S9 than I did with my old S7. Over all I like the phone but some of the changes, such as Bixby, is a waste and some of the apps I was using with my S7 don't work as well or don't work with the new OS. The cost and some of the software changes make it a negative. But the battery life is good and over all it is a big upgrade from a S7 to a S9.",4
att.com,galaxy,"To start w the Pros: ** great battery life ** camera decent (nothing extra special) ** small compact.. great for those who dont like the huge phones
Cons: ** keyboard is not as user friendly (only one keyboard option) ** Bixby voice recognition is worse than Googles, so usually have to type everything in. ** If you use the messages app.. u will have to share the same notification tone as all other apps (the option in messages to change the notification tone doesnt work) ** Theres no way to have a different message tone per contact (it has been taken away) ** In order to get the 2 options above u have to use a 3rd party app like Textra. ** The Caller ID Name is not available on the S9.",3
att.com,galaxy,"The phone performs faster than my galaxy s4 was performing. I am very disappointed about the little features that I liked on my previous phone, though. The messaging app does not allow for customization of colors, background, or notification sounds. I was worried that this phone would be too big for my hand like the galaxy s3 was, but it is slim enough that I can hold it with my small hands. I do not like the Bixby and as soon as I figure out how to turn it off, I will. I do like the pink Icon package that I was able to download. All in all, I am glad I have the new phone. Just wish I could customize my little message app.",4
att.com,galaxy,"Very pretty. All the coolest stuff. But I’m ticked off. The phone is silly slippery. I avoided using it until my case arrived. I dropped it so many times, I lost count. Furthermore, my fingers slid across the screen and I ended up tapping the wrong things constantly.
The fingerprint used to be on the front, and it was really convenient — worked well with the thumb naturally there. Now it’s on the back near the camera lens. Without the case, it’s a joke. Don’t even bother trying to use the phone without a case. It’s a nightmare.
Sadly, I will not return this phone, even though I’m really ticked off. Why? Simple....because it’s the best darn phone out there, with the very best features, and it works seamlessly. Full stop.",4
att.com,galaxy,My phone of choice was the iPhone. I've had just about every model. Until apple decided to slow my SE down (it would reboot 3 times daily) I never thought about changing. I'm extremely glad I did. I like my Galaxy S9. Google music converted all my iTunes songs so I didn't lose a thing. I'm still getting used to the phone but it's a fun journey. I can honestly say that I won't be going back to the iPhone.,5
att.com,galaxy,"The S9 is nice and sleek, but I'm unimpressed with some of the functions that are now gone. My previous phone was a Galaxy S5, so I don't know when they changed the charger, and removed some of the convenient texting functions, such as a box to check or uncheck when sending a group text so you could opt out of keeping it a group text but still send the message to everyone at once. I find there are more clicks you have to go through to accomplish small tasks such as setting alarms, and changing volume settings than previously. The are functions now missing or more complicated, such as adding a number to contacts from texts. I'm not a fan. If you want your phone to function more like an IPhone, you'll love the S9, but if you're a Galaxy fan, be prepared to do a lot more searching for things that were much more convenient previously.",3
att.com,galaxy,"I replaced an s6 with this phone because it was low on memory (only 16 mg) but this S9 does not do all that the old phone would do. I does not mirror image with my samsung smart tv. It does not have a remote for the Samsung TV. But more importantly, it drops the network and so I do not get calls or texts and cannot get calls or texts when this happens. I only find out this has happened when I try to call and it will not make a call or text. Then I worry, what did I miss. I use this phone for work. Sometimes It will start working again if I restart it but sometimes I have to take it in for service and get a new sim card and have the VPN settings reset. Last time I had them teach me to redo the settings. I would not get this expensive phone again.",1
att.com,galaxy,"I had a Samsung S5 and the screen started doing weird things so time for a new phone. The Galaxy S9 was just coming out and decided to pre order it. Screen is much clearer than what I was use to and had to get use to the wrap around screen. Seems to make it more touchy but a case solved that problem. Phone calls are much clearer and easier to understand and hear callers on speaker phone. The only negative I can see so far is the ability to send pictures by text or email. My other phone was super easy to do and easy to remember but it seems to take a little thought to do the new one. Overall I’m pleased with the phone and hope that I can get as many years out of this one, like my last phone. My husband always says his iPhone is far superior but I get better reception, more bars and better pictures with my phone and we’re with the same carrier. I’m staying with Samsung,",4
att.com,galaxy,"Had to upgrade from my S6,which I loved. This bigger, much nicer screen. The visual scan security protocol is interesting, doesn't work in the dark but can default to regular sign-in.Bought case & face cover as this rounded screenisn't as protected as the S6. So far, very pleased.",5
att.com,galaxy,I waited a long time to update from my windows phone. Didn't realize how slow or how much the windows phone was not working correctly. This phone does everything better and is very easy to use. Even the same apps that were on My old phone work better on this phone.,5
att.com,galaxy,"The phones pictures are amazing they come out so crisp all my friends and family love them. The volume on this thing is outstanding, I can here my music from a room away. I mostly love the fact that I can unlock my phone with a single touch and use Samsung pay with a single swipe up.
The only thing I am starting to dislike is that I have to type harder for the phone to sense it. I'm still getting used to it so my spelling is terrible most of the time.",5
att.com,galaxy,I'm not really crazy about the Galaxy S9. I hate that they took a lot of the message settings and other settings away. I can't even choose different personal notification sounds for my contacts. I hope the next galaxy phone will bring those settings back.,3
att.com,galaxy,"I absolutely love this phone and everything about it. The camera is incredibl, best I've ever seen. I was really nervous when I made the switch to droid,and I have to say I haven't been this happy with my phone in years! Sure a little more complex than the iPhone, but once you get the hang of it its smooth sailing from there!",5
att.com,galaxy,"So far I've been using my new Samsung Galaxy S9 for about 5 days now, heavy use each day. It's still a little early but I have no major complaints about it. It's definitely a step up from my old Galaxy S6 Active. I'd still have my old S6 but the digitizer was dying a slow painful death and I had to upgrade right away. The S9 is much faster (but not quite as fast as the European version's processor). It's easy to learn if you are already a previous Samsung owner. Bixby still needs a little work, but useful still. The camera works flawlessly and has some awesome features. Sound from the both bottom and top firing speakers is a superb improvement over previous Samsung galaxy models. Switching to the new S9 from my S6 was easy as could be in terms of transferring all my apps, photos, contacts, etc. Previous times I had to install the mobile transfer app but not with the S9. During setup I was given the option to connect my old phone with the new S9 via the supplied cable and adapter. The entire transfer took about 30 minutes and I lost absolutely NOTHING from my old phone (including my call history, texts, photos, videos, music, memos, etc!)... Battery life is acceptable and I get a full day out of it with heavy usage, much better than my old S6. The fingerprint scanner is quick and simple to unlock the phone and in a much better location than on older models. I tried fooling it several times but couldn't. It seems pretty sturdy too - I've dropped it twice, once on a tile floor, once on concrete from waist level with no damage to it (I do have a thin cover/case on it.) Overall I'm impressed with the phone and happy with my decision to upgrade to the S9.",5
att.com,galaxy,Do not get this phone if you enjoyed the basic features of your older galaxy phones. Will be returning this to ATT today and just going back to my older galaxy edge phone. So many unnecessary Samsung specific programs and apps and the Bixby button is just plain frustrating. DO NOT GET,1
att.com,galaxy,"I recently upgraded from the s7 active, to the s9. What a difference. The sensitivity of the screen out of wack. Some spots wouldn't respond at all, and others spots would just go haywire without me touching it at all. I took it into the AT&T store and the tech guy said that people had been having the same type of issues a lot lately. He swapped out the phone for me and so far everything has been okay with this one. A friend of mine went through exactly the same thing with her s9 plus. Be cautious when choosing your next phone.",3
att.com,galaxy,"I have only purchased Galaxy phones , but this one is by far the best one yet. The display is clear, the options available are great, and the ease of transition from the S7 to the S9 was perfect.",5
att.com,galaxy,"This phone is awesome. You need to use a nice case though. Which is no problem. Once I put the shock proof case on it, it has the same feel of my older S5 Active . The buttons aren't as sensitive as my old phone so I don't activate stuff putting it in my pocket. The buttons on the face are set in the touch screen so they aren't depressed by mistake either. I really don't understand all the negative reviews! But some people just need to complain about anything. Buy this phone.",5
att.com,galaxy,"I was skeptical of the tall design at first, but you are able to make the notifications pull down by checking an option that lets them come down anytime you drag down on the homescreen no matter where your finger is on it, so you don't have to go all the way to the top of the phone. After you figure that out you get to use the full length of the screen to read even more of a webpage or a text etc, which is nice.
The performance is great, the battery life is pretty good. The screen is curved just like the s6/7 edge and glass screen protectors like to pop up/off when a case presses against the sides of it. You can either get a plastic protector or there are a few glass protectors that have adhesive you apply before putting the screen on. Of course your luck will vary, some cases don't press on the screen protectors like others.
The iris/face scanner is really nice. I don't know how but the iris scanner even works in pitch black darkness. This means you have a face/iris/finger/code to unlock your device so one way or another you can unlock it.
Oh and I forgot to mention the most significant thing. Because it is tall and not wide, this somehow makes it the perfect width for texting. I text with one thumb and I've never had a phone that texts as good as this one. The keys are the perfect spacing and when I initially started texting I noticed I wasn't making any mistakes, at all. My thumb was hitting everything perfectly. On wider/bigger phones you have to stretch your thumb to some keys and it just creates an inaccurate experience. No such problem on this phone, it is a texting dream.
It also has a blood pressure sensor in it, but you have to google to get the right app to do it.
Overall I'm very impressed. If I had 1 thing to complain about it would be the curved screen. I know they want to give it a sort of *infinity* edge screen but it doesn't seem to gain you anything and hitting a button that is on the very edge can be somewhat less sensitive than the main part of the screen, but this is very minor and barely ever noticed. It is a great phone. Get the edge 24 month as it is the best deal and get a new phone every year.",5
att.com,galaxy,"Bluetooth does not work, sound issues. AT&T objected to details I originally submitted. No one will assist with fixing 7 day old phone.",1
att.com,galaxy,"I went from HTC to the Samsung Galaxy S9, I am still getting used to using it, but it is very much user friendly. Once I know how to do everything that I want it to do, it will be a very successful purchase. Good product! Would recommend to anyone that does not want the iPhone.",5
att.com,galaxy,"I've been a Apply user since the Iphone 4. I recently upgraded from the 7 plus and I just didn't like how Apple slowed my battery down so much and the fact the got rid of the headset jack. I was a little intimidated to change over to Samsung, but man I'm loving this S9!! Its way more advanced and customizable and it really helps in my everyday life. Especially as a manager. So far I couldn't be happier with this phone. I'm not trying to say that Apple doesn't make a great phone, because they do. But this Samsung fits my needs to a capital T. I would highly recommend this device to anyone who is thinking about making the jump from apple. I also love the expandable memory with the SD card Slot! :D",5
att.com,galaxy,"Don't know what the hype is all about...the only new thing I can find kinda cool is the slow motion camera option. One think I would not recomend, is getting the glass screen cover for the phone..it interferes with the keyboard (delay keystrokes) The microphone is poor picking up the correct words when speech texting. The lilac color is cool, other than that I wish I would of just upgraded to an S8",2
att.com,galaxy,"Although I checked the length of the phone, I did not check the width. The phone is way too narrow for my liking. The curve on the edge of the screen is annoying. Sometimes you have to tap it two or three times to get it to work. I use my phone a lot for work and personal use. I would have never picked this phone if I had any previous experience with it. Now I'm stuck with it for a year. Should have went to a store instead, they're much more helpful.",2
att.com,galaxy,"I was so happy with my Galaxy S5 Active that I had not even considered an upgrade. But once I held the Galaxy S9 in my hands and experienced all that it is capable of, I finally upgraded. And with the right phone case, it even has the charging port cover like my S5 Active.",5
att.com,galaxy,I am basically the Murphy's Law when it comes to phones. I completely destroyed my phone to the point the screen was glitching. I was able to upgrade to the Galaxy S9 with no problem. AT&T was also doing a great deal; buy one get one free. So I was also able to surprise my husband with a new phone. We both love our new phones. Everything about the phone is great that I could go on and on. But I will say my process of getting a new phone was super easy and the staff was great!,5
att.com,galaxy,My husband dropped his old phone and cracked the screen. Since we were due for an upgrade we dealt with a super sales rep who offered a a sweet deal on this phone. The best thing was there was no difference using this phone and our Galaxy S6 Active. There are good updates on this phone and I am still discovering more. The camera takes much better pictures and the screen is a bit bigger than the old phone. Very happy with this purchase!,5
att.com,galaxy,"I am already a full fledged Galaxy convert. The 9 doesn't disappoint. The camera is beautiful, I love the new keyboard features , including GIFs. We had a blast making our own emoticons.The screen is beautiful. I also love the larger resolution on the screen that enables me to have more app spots. I have all of my apps on 1 page whereas I needed 2 with my older Galaxy. The speakers offer great sound as well.",5
att.com,galaxy,i love this phone it is great i keeping this phone forever ok,5
att.com,galaxy,Samsung S9 has low durability,1
att.com,galaxy,love this phone..great camera and features,5
att.com,galaxy,I ordered this phone for my husband. Wasn’t totally sure how the blue would look in person but wanted something other than black and was pleasantly surprised at the color. It’s very pretty and he loves it. He set up the retinal scan on his phone right away and it’s amazing. He doesn’t have to have the phone at eye level or anything but it always knows if he’s the one holding it. It gives you 15 tries to unlock the phone before you get locked out of it and have to factory reset which he feels good about incase it ever gets lost or stolen.,5
att.com,galaxy,"Ever since I got my first iPhone, I looked at Samsung as another option for my daily driver. My iPhone 6 was a great phone.... that is until Apple decided to throttle it to force me to upgrade. In a way, they won. But in forcing me over the edge to upgrade, they revealed their shoddy business strategies and their anti-consumer attitude. That attitude made me look at Samsung again, and I knew I had made my decision. The Samsung Galaxy S9 is a wonderful, fast, and complete device that I believe is worth every penny. Thank you, Samsung.",5
att.com,galaxy,I liked all excpet the size. I thought it was too narrow and felt like it was slipping out of my hands. I ended up sending it back.,4
att.com,galaxy,"The phone has sutble but very apparent upgrades from it's most recent predecessor (S8/Note). The interface is very responsive, apps run so much smoother/faster and the camera is AMAZING! I was skeptical at first but the video and camera take the best pics I've seen on any smartphone. The weight of the phone is a little bit more but for me I really like the additional weight, feels great in the hand. My little girl has tested the water submersion feature when we were at the pool and had to swim 10feet to get it, and works just fine! Overall, it's definitely an upgrade from the S8. I almost forgot to mention the finger sensor! It's actually located in the middle, right below the camera this time! I think the S8s biggest flaw was the location of the sensor which was NOT in the middle and offset to leftof the camera. It took some time for my finger to actually get accustomed to the location and not touch the camera lens itself.",5
att.com,galaxy,"I was at the lake and dropped my galaxy s9 in about 12 feet of water. A friend got a fishing net and tried for 30 to 40 minutes before he retrieved my phone, I took the otterbox cover off and dried the outside of my phone and made a phone call. That was three months ago and I am still using the phone and it works perfectly.",5
att.com,galaxy,"This phone has been wonderful. I've had take some time learning the ways to make it work properly, and instead of having a how to book, you now take the tutorial on the phone. This is nice, but not exactly my preference, I like to read before use, not being electronics savvy.",4
att.com,galaxy,I am not excited about the Samsung Galaxy S9. It is slow and sometimes it will stop for a few seconds while you are scrolling. My Samsung Galaxy S8 is faster and better than this Samsung Galaxy S9. Even the looks of this Galaxy S9 is not as exciting than the Galaxy S8.,3
att.com,galaxy,"I was very hesitant at first, because I've had LG for a very long time, but I decided to make the switch to the galaxy S9. And I love it! Very easy to use, great camera, has pretty much everything I need. Glad I made the switch!",5
att.com,galaxy,Great phone! I was in need of an upgrade and it took about an hour to complete the purchase at the store. This phone is faster in all respects. From charging to using apps and search engines. Battery life is super long.,5
att.com,galaxy,I just purchased the Galaxy S9 phone. I have previously had 2 Samsung phones. The curved phone is not user friendly for me and doesn't feel comfortable. I have small hands and the S9+ and the Note were too big for my hands and didn't feel comfortable more so than the S9. My husband update to the iphone 8 which is the same size as his 6 and he likes the size. The larger phones are not user friendly for the older generation. There are too many pre-installed apps and too many pop ups.,3
att.com,galaxy,I love my new phone. It works great and now all my pictures are so clear. The only thing I regret is not getting the s+ because it would fit my hand perfectly. The 9 is a little small,5
att.com,galaxy,"I got my new phone and began the process of adding my old info to it. The phone has many new features that did take a few days to get used to (volume is in a different place then my old Samsung) and so I kept messing everything up for a while. I love the graphics and the photos it takes are great. Now I am very glad I upgraded my phone. The curved edge takes a minute or two to get used to, but it really has so many positives I don't mind. I love the fingerprint identification.",5
att.com,galaxy,"It all started out well, then the app cell wouldnt stop getting slower spying on me running several apps when I asked it not to. That cell should last 18 hours. I helped program it and im sad to say it isn't worth it mines broke. I hope the S10 is better. All I want is my cell to listen to only me, especially spending 900 dollars the cell should know this person owns this cell. Unfortunatly government data and marketing all have higher classifications on that cell then the owner.",1
att.com,galaxy,"Some apps either freeze or take long to open. Beautiful design, sleek. Other than the lagging here and there i like the phone",3
att.com,galaxy,"I upgraded, finally, from the S5, and boy oh boy, what a difference! So much quicker, faster response and the camera is amazing!",5
att.com,galaxy,I love my Samsung Galaxy S9. Very easy to use. The only thing I dont like is u cant make different ring tones for contacts,5
att.com,galaxy,Not what I was expecting. The basic android system is the same in all android phones and I’m not a fan.,3
att.com,galaxy,Its so sleek and cute. No phone compares to the 9. I love my new phone!!!!,5
att.com,galaxy,I just love my Galaxy 9.i upgrade from a7 the best .Recommended,5
att.com,galaxy,Small has a bunch of ads that pop up very irritating if my watching Netflix it kicks me completely out for a ad,2
att.com,galaxy,"I have only had the Galaxy S9 for a week. Overall, it is pretty good product. Similar to my 7. Haven't really had an opportunity to explore all the features, but the pictures are crystal clear. The only set back I see is the charging time and battery life. It takes almost half a day to fully charge and is drained by half the day with no apps running in the background. Even with that I still feel confident in the product.",3
att.com,galaxy,Besides the curved glass and my fat fingers pressing things on the corners.. i dislike this phone with all my being. Quickbooks doesnt run. So running a business off a s9 terrible. Battery life in my area thru winter. Terrible. Got the phone to save a few dollars on my bill. Proving to be a waste of money. New update reset all of my sounds and ringtones. Not a huge issue. But not enjoying the samsung experience at all.,1
att.com,galaxy,I upgraded from an S6 Active to this so I don't know if I am necessarily the person to be giving a review of all the tasty technical bits since clearly I hold on to old tech for too long. So far it has been a great upgrade for me. Not sure about the edge-style screen though as it seems a little vulnerable even in the case I have but I guess I'll get used to it. Works great for me for what little I do with it.,4
att.com,galaxy,"After having a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 for the last three years, I upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy S9 and I am glad I did. I like the lilac purple color and how much smaller it is and it is easier for me to hold in my small hands. The phone is fast, the audio quality is fantastic, and I like all of the features it comes with. I also enjoy the camera and the new camera settings. I recommend this phone to everyone.",5
att.com,galaxy,"I have had a smartphone for years and NEVER had anything break or crack. I upgraded from S7 to S9 a couple of months ago. Keep it in a case with screen protector all of the time. Dropped it while sitting down (maybe 3ft) on a wooden floor and it cracked up the back. For the price you pay for a phone, it definitely should not be so fragile. I will take the bulk of the phone over delicate profile any day.",3
att.com,galaxy,"I had a iPhone for years and my husband had samsung. When we figured out why my iPhones weren't last 2 years I decided to try Samsung again for my next phone. I got the Samsung s9 and I love it. It's so fast, the battery life is amazing I go to bed with it fully charged and it only loses 1% over night. Also the cell reception is better. I am so happy with my decision to get this phone, and ITS PURPLE!!!",5
att.com,galaxy,"This phone is under 3 months old. It worked fine for about 3 weeks then started to act up. It defaults to a White Screen and takes you to the Home screen while you are viewing email or text msg or app's imbedded. Samsung blames the carrier, the carrier blames the manufacturer and the stores 'Squad' blames 3rd party apps. All play store apps have been removed and still it fails. I had an iPhone 5S that worked well and was excited to upgrade. I have been sorely disappointed and very angry that no one wants to own up to a bad phone. See YouTube offering below. Now it appears my phone does this everywhere and AT&T is sending a tech to my house even though I told them this happens everywhere. This problem seems to be an systemic problem with AT&T's Mobile phone service and they definitely don't want to hear that. Search for 'Galaxy S9 Failure on YouTube to view the shutdown that occurs.",1
att.com,galaxy,"I could go on for hours. It's fast, and I mean really fast. It's got a great camera. The screen resolution is simply awsome. The edge looks cool. Did I mention it's fast? The settings are easy to find and easy to search for. The features are endless, so just look up stuff like best S9 apps, and that sort of thing, and you'll find great stuff. I MUST mention the handiest app I found - Xender - which transfers large files wirelessly phone-to-phone and best of all, phone-to-computer (or the other way around), with no cables or data usage. I recommend the Otterbox Defender case for this phone. Mix the toughness specs on this phone with that Otterbox, and you'll get mind-blowing protection; even better than the old AT&T Samsung Active series. Overall, I'm SO glad I got this phone. We took advantage of a BOGO offer when we added a line to our account. So, at half the price -WHAT A DEAL! ;^)",5
att.com,galaxy,Its a really bad phone the cameras ok but the sumer slow motion is terible. The phone has so many glitches like when im watching YouTube it leaves the app without me touching the screen. And i cant take videos because it randomly stops them. I had this phone for a little over 3 months and i already need a new one. I think i might go back to my i phone 4 because that thing works better than the s9.,1
att.com,galaxy,I have had my galaxy s9 for 7 months and the contacts app keeps force closing constantly. Took my phone to my network provider and they did troubleshooting for 2 hours before factory resetting it. Less than 24 hours later and it’s doing it again!! Except now I can’t even answer calls it says “calls has failed” ridiculous! The only good thing is the camera. Which is all mine is good for right now!,1
att.com,galaxy,"My phone turns on and off throughout the day, this is the 3rd one I’ve had each with different problems. Samsung has had a lot of problems for me no matter which one I’ve tried, I’m extremely unhappy.",1
att.com,galaxy,"Its okay, still getting use to it...I sorta wish it was larger since I am getting older I like more view. Clear and quicker. Don't like all the apps downloaded already and Bixty is annoys me.",3
att.com,galaxy,"I have had this phone for 4 months, and it has recently started booting me back to the home screen while watching videos. While playing music over bluetooth audio will cut out periodically. Voice to text software is way behind my old s7, messes up everything when it doesnt say ""voice input unavailable."" Not a good experience and in the future I will not be buying any samsung phones",2
att.com,galaxy,"The new Samsung S9 is nice, fast, sleek, and has a long battery life, but the memory just isnt' enough. I'm a systems power user, I use my phone for computing, remote access, etc and I have certain apps that need the memory. Most phones have 6gigs / 128gig like Asus. If you're into Samsung this phone is great but I'm going to return it and keep with Asus. Oh, and no apple ever.",3
att.com,galaxy,"Last fall I replaced my S7 with the S9. While the S9 has nice features, like more space and improved camera, I can't get past losing the dedicated buttons on the bottom of the screen. The three sliding buttons are sometimes visible and sometimes become visible when the bottom is swiped up. It takes two actions (swipe and select) to do the same thing a dedicated button did with one touch. Also, the three buttons appear and disappear unexpectedly at times, and wrong buttons can be touched. For example, when trying to hit the 'back' button, it has disappeared and I've accidentally touched the video call button in one of my apps.
One other frustration I have is with the rolled edge. If I'm holding the phone with one hand and also use the thumb of that hand to touch the screen, the base of my thumb touches the edge and the phone responds as if I intentionally touched that area. Never had that problem with the S7.",3
att.com,galaxy,This is by far the best phone out right now. The 1 star reviews are bogus and I think its user error not phone. Or the Apple fan boys who cant handle I phone you can actually do stuff on other than make calls and text. So if you want boring go with the same old Apply that all look the same or If you want fun and be able to customize everything you want buy the S9,5

att.com,galaxy,"I have been a Samsung Phone Fan for a long time and this new one is great. It is fast, has plenty of memory and the battery lasts a long time. The only problem that I have is that the keyboard in the vertical position is very small and my man hands are a bit big for it. Wish I got the S9+ which is a bit bigger and may have a better chance of fewer type O's.",4
att.com,galaxy,"I looooove this phone. It has face scan, finger scan and iris scan. I switched from s5 to s9. It has everything I want in a phone. It has fast charging. My son loves ar emogi and slow mo. It is not status symbol but who cares I love the design and specs of s9. Probably iPhone will place the touch id at the back too on their next one",5
att.com,galaxy,Upgraded from S8+ to S9+. EVERY one of the few issues the S8 had have been resolved! Fingerprint scanner is now in a logical location; facial recognition added to iris scan to make unlocking your device much easier; and the camera lives up to all the hype! 6GB RAM on the Plus is more than enough to make this phone lightning fast.,5
att.com,galaxy,"Upgraded from S5 mini, which had become slow and memory constrained by the latest apps. This S9 quadrupled my base memory and with a 400GB SD card (I used a 200GB), plenty of room for pictures, movies, etc. New features, but still familiar. Easy to transfer all apps and data from the old phone. The wireless charger is a good add on.",5
att.com,galaxy,It's a lot different then my s6 . But I'm learning,4
att.com,galaxy,I am in love with this phone. Had a lg g6 and it was awesome but I am a die hard Samsung fan. The camera is amazing along with a lot of other features. Definantly a win. If you d have not like the Samsung edge phones that doesn't matter with this one it's hardly noticeable and doesn't interfere with anything you are doing.,4
att.com,galaxy,"It is user friendly, but half the time the keyboard doesn't pop up for me to type. This can be on any site. I have to restart to make it work. Very frustrating. Researching the issue suggest installing another keyboard. So far I haven't found one I like as well. It seemed to get a little better after I updated some apps.",3
att.com,galaxy,Not impressed with this phone,3
att.com,galaxy,"I had my galaxy s8 for about 2 years and upgraded to the s9. It was not worth the money. Hardly any changes from s8 to s9. I should've just waited for the s10 or foldable phone. I'm soooooooo disappointed.
Otherwise it's a great phone. But save yourself some money and go with the s8 or wait a bit longer.",3
att.com,galaxy,"The big bad flagship phone. Only one notification tone for all notifications including text tones. That's right no more personalized text tones for contacts. So it's got a better camera than the s7. Woo hood. I'm going back to my s7. Samsung, fix this crap. even the old flip phones had this feature.",2
att.com,galaxy,"I’ve always had a galaxy and I went from the 8 to the 9. There’s really not too much different, just some small changes. I upgraded to give my son the 8 and loves it. He switched from iPhone so he’s much happier with the galaxy. The price and specials they have for this phone made it even better.",5
att.com,galaxy,"The phone has so many features I don't know where to start. I love all the new addons for the camera. Being able to write on the pics, high resolution, and quality pics. I love being able to reach my apps from the edge in a second. I'm still getting familiar with my new toy. This one is a winner",4
att.com,galaxy,"This is a big mess of S9 awesomeness! Upgraded from the S7. There's not much of a difference with functionality but the speed, oh my the speed, difference is huge. That alone was worth it to me. Also has superb battery life and the camera is like woah. Could only be happier if it were free!",5
att.com,galaxy,I had left the galaxy family for Apple's iphone 8. Hated that decision. I love the galaxy 9 the camera is amazing a most have. No phone can touch it. Display is the next level. The best color and video quality is like looking at my uhd TV. What more can I say but better get one of your own,5
att.com,galaxy,My wife needed a newer phone to replace her Samsung Galaxy S5. Went with the S9 because it should last for 2-3 years or when the 5G LTE makes it obsolete. We only have AT&T because of the better coverage in our area. I wish AT&T offered the Google phone and other lesser known phones.,1
att.com,galaxy,I just upgraded from a Samsung S5 to a Samsung S9. Loving the curved screen and clear display. Syncing my old phone to my new phone to transfer files and photos was challenging but I got it figured out without contacting pro-tech for help. The starter guide was a definite help!,5
att.com,galaxy,"Overall, it's not much different from my S6, IMO. The camera is way better, though. I miss having the home and back keys. I haven't gotten down the way to touch my screen for that, yet. The larger screen is nice, but nothing *that* spectacular. Overall, I'm pleased with my S9.",4
att.com,galaxy,"The S9 case is very, very slick. Within 2 days I dropped mine, and I thought I had a good grip. The curved screen and side bar thing takes a little getting use to. Performance is nice. What is Bixby and why do I want it? Also, pre-installed apps should just go away.",4
att.com,galaxy,S9 is a great phone great camera fast processor the best screen on a phone hands down great build quality ip68 rating for water and dust 3.5 headphone jack with some cool features ok headphones included but if you don't like a heavy skin on android better look else where.,4
att.com,galaxy,"I like the phone but my S5 had a one open button and the S9 doesnt. So you have to fumble for the button to open everything. Also, it seems like when I didnt do anything, apps open and it is a little confusing. Like did I really open that or did it just do it by itself.",3
att.com,galaxy,I love my new Samsung Galaxy S9 phone..It has great features and I am sooo glad I got it...My LG2 phone was not a good one to have...It became frustrating and I had and wanted the new phone...haven't tried all the features but I love the slim look and easy to handle...,5
att.com,galaxy,"i bought this phone about half year ago, i am so regretted for this. This phone basically gors overheating everyday which makes me worry like i worry about note 7. i need to charge my phone at least 3times a day. The phone is running really slow. bad experience.",1
att.com,galaxy,"I bought this yesterday in place of the j7 and i was given the option to buy a LG V35 trust me this is far better, Camera is clear and crispy. Performance is fine, display is sharp only thing is battery wish it was better. Ar emoji as well SAMSUNG!! LOL",5
att.com,galaxy,So far I love it and it's easy to use! I was a little nervous because this phone uses type C chargers but they provide you with an adapter you can place on your older Samsung charger cord and you can also buy them. I previously had a Samsung note 5.,5
att.com,galaxy,just updated my phone and did the Bogota for another phone for my granddaughter and so far its working wonderful once I got all my preferences straightened out it has more features than I need so I'm still learning as I discover each and everyone,5
att.com,galaxy,The Samsung GalaxyS9 is a little bit of awesome in your hand . So many ways to explore. Getting used to the size although compact it's still a bit longer than my old phone . I am enjoying learning the new features every day. Photos are fantastic,5
att.com,galaxy,"I love this phone so much. Its fast, its fluid, its screen is amazing, and the camera is incredible. I wish the battery life was a little bit better but I can't complain. It is great with other Samsung products as well. (Tv's, Watches, Tabs).",5
att.com,galaxy,I simply adore every aspect of this phone. The camera quality is incredible & the apps that are already included save me from having to download a ton of things right away. The phone itself is also very beautiful & the perfect size.,5
att.com,galaxy,"Truly like the ease of setting this up. LOVE the edge feature where I have 6 shortcuts (10 frequently used apps, 10 frequent contacts, smart select to capture an image, reminders, to do list, calendar). Love the full screen.",4
att.com,galaxy,This is a really nice phone. I feel like the only true upgrade it has compared to my Samsung Galaxy S7 is the camera. The camera is great. The rest is pretty much business as usual. Don't spend the money unless you need to.,4
att.com,galaxy,"I upgraded from a Samsung S5 to the new S9. As with all upgrades, it took a while to find everything but once I did, it was great. Lots of very nice features and quick shortcuts to apps. Plus the Lilac color is beautiful",5
att.com,galaxy,"didn't realize I was getting the newest version when I ordered it.....just figured it was new enough to find accessories. good phone, love Samsung. better than APPLE!! has been great for the week I have had it.",5
att.com,galaxy,"I actually love this phone I totally enjoy the photos I am taking with this phone, I always was a iPhone person so the change is a little intimidating, so much to learn but the clary of the phone is what I enjoy.",5
att.com,galaxy,This phone is as good if not a little better than the iPhone X unless you are a die hard iPhone fan. The graphics are great and all the whistles and bells make it a good buy will google. Play items being all free.,5
att.com,galaxy,"Phone has numerous features and Apps that I will working on using what I can over the next couple of months. Too early to how it compares, but generally speaking, I have had no problems with Samsung products.",5
att.com,galaxy,"I just switched over from Sprint, and found out that AT&T's android phones does not have the capability to group tex no more than 10 contacts at a time. That makes me work harder, since Sprint would allow 30.",3
att.com,galaxy,"This is a beautiful phone, much slimmer than my 7S and a little longer. Everything transferred from my old phone including my theme song. I love my new phone! It keeps a charge and charges in minutes.",5
att.com,galaxy,"GS9 replaced my old and trusty GS3 (yeah...I know.), and I am very impressed with its look and feel. Camera is AWESOME! Still exploring its features and tools, so I can't be very detailed. But WOWzers",5
att.com,galaxy,"I own this piece of hardware, yet I dont own it at all. The bootloader is locked, and I am unable to take root authority of the software. I'm tired of samsung bloat software and annoying ui decisions.",1
att.com,galaxy,"The phone gets 4 stars. The battery gets 2. The battery at first was amazing. Lasted all day. Now, after several updates, it goes down fast. Not sure what happened. Phone is only 5 months old.",3
att.com,galaxy,It is not as simple to nbn navigate like the previous models and I can't figure out how to screenshot,2
att.com,galaxy,"Super fast, super slim, super light and it has a really good camera. It was love at first sight, but don't buy it with AT&T. Its way cheaper (about $150 cheaper) anywhere else and unlocked*.",5
att.com,galaxy,"My old galaxy 5 was much better. Texting is a chore. Tapping numbers, letters and symbols is difficult. Does not always respond. Have been temprted many times to throw it against the wall.",2
att.com,galaxy,"I absolutely LOVE the galaxy! I have had the S5, S7, S8, and now the S9. They really are the best phones. Haven't ever had a problem out of them. Go with the galaxy, you won't regret it!",5
att.com,galaxy,The phone itself is nice. The problems are that once again Samsung has made weak and ineffective charging system that breaks and renders several awesome features of the phone worthless.,1
att.com,galaxy,"I love the edge, you can do more than an iphone. Only complaint coming from someone who has been an iPhone user texting prediction is better on iPhone and emoji does not auto populate",4
att.com,galaxy,I'm not sure wha the others are saying about not being able to text or email but you can do all of that and a lot more. I love my Galaxy s9 and the video and display are great,5
att.com,galaxy,"I’ve never had a Samsung cell phone before, so I was kinda nervous about getting this one. It has been so easy to learn the differences between it and the iPhone. I love it!",5
att.com,galaxy,"It, along with all of Samsung's premium handsets, are for people who want an iPhone but do not want to be seen owning an iPhone. Contrarian types, basically. I am. Are you?",5
att.com,galaxy,"The Gaxay S9 camera takes great pics and the videos are fantastic, even when zooming in they remain clear. I just need a little more time getting use to all that it can do.",5
att.com,galaxy,"I love it and it great but one thing I need help with my Gmai account, and it don't let me log out and I don't want to remove my account it don't have long out or sign out",5
att.com,galaxy,I love the fact that the pictures come out amazing and this phone helps you track your health if u are into exercise and it also helps you track food calories and more,5

att.com,galaxy,"I have had this phone since mid July. The reception is awful. On most calls either I cannot hear the other person, or they cannot hear me. Waste of lots of $$$.",1
att.com,galaxy,"I am beyond satisfied with my new phone! The quality, images, speed, and features of this phone exceeded my expectations when I first decided to get the Galaxy 9.",5
att.com,galaxy,Nice phone. Hate Bixby button. Micro SD slot design could be a little better. But since I put in a 256GB card I guess I shouldn't have to remove it often.,4
att.com,galaxy,"Didn't live up to what I thought it would. Sent it back the next day. But AT&T is a great cellular carrier, service is excellent. I recommended to my friend!",1

att.com,galaxy,"Very fast, crisp display. I wish I had gotten the + because there is some background apps that can't be removed that do eat through the 4GB RAM quickly.",5
att.com,galaxy,Have had all the models since the Galaxy S3 and with this latest model Samsung keeps elevating the standards. Very elegant and fine piece of equipment.,5
att.com,galaxy,I like this model because it is slimmer. That makes it easier to use and hold. I haven't used all of my apps yet but the ones that I have used I like.,4
