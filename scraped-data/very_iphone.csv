5 out of 5 stars.,"Upgraded from my iPhone 6S. Features are considerably better as you would expect. Display is gorgeous and sound quality excellent due to the 2 built in stereo speakers. Only took me an hour to get used to not having the home button. I actually prefer the Face ID over the finger print scanner is it works quicker. There are a few additional features which I didn’t have on the iPhone 6S, such as Apple spreadsheets, word and PowerPoint specifically designed for phones which some people might find useful. Great price and interest free over a year. The only downside is you have to pay extra for a fast 12W charger as only the basic 5W charger is supplied.

4 out of 5 stars.,"The iphone X is still better than the new Iphone XR in terms of features especially as it has the dual cameras compared to the single camera. Although the XR chip is the latest model I feel chips don't really improve the phone unless theres a gap of 2 between the latest chip. The dual sims is a good incentive but it's not really relevant unless you have a work sim.

Being more android savvy it took me a couple of days to get used to the iOS way of doing things but it comes pretty easy once you start using it. Have to say the camera is by far apples best to date, the apps open quickly and so far run smoothly. If your into apple phones, the iPhone X is a must. If your more android, give the X some serious thought it’s by far apples best.

5 out of 5 stars.,"Having owned all iPhones over the years & enjoyed something in all of them, in my opinion this exceeds expectations & is the best all rounder yet. Switched from iPhone 7 plus - wanted a more compact phone with similar screen size. The new OLED screen is absolutely superb, bionic operating system is lightning fast & as always with Apple - everything just works. New features are excellent, build quality is reassuringly solid & expensive (invest in a case though - the back is made of glass) overall if you are in the market with this sort of budget go for it, you won't look back. Buying outright also saves a little on most contract rates over 24 mk this & gives you the option of using any network. Delivered next day - thanks littlewoods- I'm loving this..!

Instead at 5pm I got a message to say it was out for delivery and when I checked the tracking it said it had been signed for that morning at 11am. I went down to the post office asap but due to it being past 5 on the Friday they said I would have to come back on Tuesday as this was the next working day due to the bank holiday. I was working on the Tuesday and gave my ID to someone to collect it for me but they advised I had to come in person due to the price of the item. So I didn’t even get the phone until the Wednesday! overall it was worth the wait. Battery life is amazing! I went from a standard iPhone and the transition of the size of the phone is fine. You get used to having a bigger phone. Takes time getting used to not having a home button but the Face ID is really responsive. The only problem I’ve noticed is it doesn’t work when you’re lying down on your side as it needs to recognise your full face.

Having owned iPhone 6 plus before I liked the large screen but the bulk of the phone was a bit of an annoyance. iPhone X solves the issue and can be, in my case, easily operated with one hand. It's lightning fast, FaceID works perfectly and very cleverly (won't unlock if you don't look at the phone) and the new gestures are easy to master. The migration from my old iPhone to the new one was fast and seamless. Over all a great piece of kit and I strongly recommend it one the iPhone 8.

5 out of 5 stars.,"I had been using my old, slow running iPhone 6 for 3+ years and kept telling myself I didn’t need a new phone. However, after dropping my iPhone 6 I thought it was a sign to change with the times and I am so glad I did! The iPhone X is leaps and bounds better than my previous iPhone. It is slick, fast running and has an unreal camera! I have nothing bad to say about it, only thing I would advise though is to invest in a decent phone cover as it is fully glass front and back so if you were to drop it then it would be an expensive mistake to make! So go for it, don’t wait as long as I did... you won’t regret it!

5 out of 5 stars.,"I got this phone not too long ago and it was an amazing upgrade from my iPhone 6S Plus. I was contemplating going for the iPhone 8 Plus but I decided that I would just take a leap and get the X. It was a great purchase. Got the phone the next day of ordering it. Setting the phone up was a BREEZE. As anyone who has upgraded from and iPhone to a new iPhone, you simply backup your content and download it back, it's as easy as that. The phone is very fast and the new gestures on the X to compensate for no home button on the home are great.I would definitely recommend getting a case and screen protector, even if you do have insurance on it as the phone will most likely damage easier than previous iterations. The face id takes a while to get used to from using the finger print scanner as you'll try to unlock the phone by using your thumb quite a bit, but in time it'll stop. Face ID is amazing and for me personally is more consistent than the finger print scanner, especially if you're out and about and sometimes the scanner doesn't read your finger. The camera is amazing and as someone who doesn't use cameras much, this surprised me so much. All in all, if you have an old iPhone and are looking for an upgrade, I would recommend the X and same goes for anyone moving over from the Android family.

Apple have removed the fingerprint sensor, which worked fast and reliably. The facial recognition doesn’t always respond. Especially first thing in a morning.
Battery life not significantly better, not I’d the procecessor speed noticeably faster.

But when I checked one out in person I decided to go for it. I’m well impressed with it. Face ID works amazingly well, it’s so handy to glance at the phone and notifications unravel. My secure apps that all worked with Touch ID now work with Face ID. again, it just works. The screen size is excellent, ok, Android users have enjoyed this for a lot less cash. But I’m a fan of iOS, I’d rather not have to ‘manage’ my OS. The short cut features do take some re-training, but they make complete sense and after a day or two come naturally. I’m very happy with the X. Definitely the future of iPhone.

5 out of 5 stars.,"It’s expensive and it is essentially “just a iPhone”, but it’s worth it. Everything about it feels premium, from the screen, build quality, camera and Face ID which works great. Is it worth the price? As someone who uses their phone heavily daily, it’s worth it. Only negative is some of the apps don’t use the full screen, and battery life isn’t quite as good as my old iPhone 7 Plus.

5 out of 5 stars.,"So the iPhone X has finally arrived.. what can i say? Its the best iPhone yet. Although it is expensive the fact that its an iphone 10 you are well ahead of the game. The screen is clear and sharp and you can tell the differenc in quality compared to the other iphone models. I was suggest anyone thinking of buying the iphone x to invest in Apple Care, Insurance and a case as you dont want to damage this due to its price tag! Anyone who hasnt used an iPhone should note that this phone takes a Nano sim which is a lot smaller than the regular micro sim.
Camera quality is great so much better with the new features of face mapping. You will need to get used to the new gestures but this is overcome within a day.
Face ID works well but be aware if you leave the sticker on the screen after setting it up then it wont work correctly. Remove the protective plastic, reset face id and then set it up again.

I've upgraded from the iPhone 6 and there is an impressive array of new features. The camera is a huge draw and the quality is incredible but the animojis and AR are also fun features which I didnt realise I would have so much fun with! The phone itself looks incredible, the glass back is stunning, although I have put a projector on both the front and the back just to be on the safe side. This was my first purchase from Very and I was very impressed, the phone arrived a week before my expected delivery date and arrived within 18 hours of recieving the dispatch notification!

Definitely a lot heavier that previous phones probably put it down to the glass and chrome frame. Screen lives up to expectations navigation is easy no button is somewhat refreshing. Animoji is hilariously fun! The black bar at the top isn’t annoying as people have made it seem I like that the icons look cute up there tucked away in the corner. Quality 10 Value A little steep considering the price of replacement if there is any damage. Features the same with a few extra perks. Smooth edges gorgeous finish.

5 out of 5 stars.,"I am not an Apple fan boy as I have had more Android handsets than iphones, but I have had every iPhone that apple has produced, well in sizes anyway. The iPhone X (Ten) is obviously the best. I know that Apple have just caught up with wireless charging and OLED screen before anyone starts saying that they have been behind for years, but here is the crunch, Apple have done it better! Wireless is the same, can't really top that, but the OLED screen is a master! No other smartphone produces the display in a way. Samsung, and the Chinese phones that say 'Near bezelless' are just that. They still have chins! Yes the iPhone has the notch, but after only a few hours you don't notice it. Then there is the 'No Home Button' honestly, once you are using the gestures you will wonder why you needed it! Face ID works perfectly and after using it for a week I can now open the phone as quick as I could with touch ID. As Apple always say...It just works. Now they have added the bits that android fans have been going on about for years this phone for me is now the best. IOS (Apples software) is awesome, can't say I will be using the Animoji that much, but down the line I am sure there will be some fantastic things that you will be able to do with it. Trust me, with the processing power this thing has it will handle IOS for the next 4 years easy. How long will android phones released this year get the latest version of android...? They will struggle. £1,000 is a lot of money, but when you take that over 4 years, compared to paying £500 for a android phone every year.... It's cheap!

2 out of 5 stars.,"Had this delivered on Saturday and straight away there was an issue with the display. The phone would randomly open apps and even deleted a few without any input. I spent the afternoon in an apple store having a new screen assembly fitted under the warranty as very didn’t let me return the item. Even Apple said I should return for a replacement but I knew it would be a pain to explain the situation over the phone. Luckily I had a video of the phone doing all of this which was taken on my wife’s mobile and as soon as the Apple employee saw it he knew it was faulty. The phone itself is great - now it’s workijg as it should but I can’t give the whole experience a positive review I’m afraid.

However after having the iPhone for 6hours the screen as become completely unresponsive, after restoring the whole phone via iTunes, nothing on the screens works or the Face ID. So you can’t even set it up again. It’s got the screen software fix installed. And surprise surprise there thousand of people online having the same problem. And it’s a huge problem getting it changed under normal warranty. Apple wants the full amount it cost to hold unti it’s repaired and proven not to be your fault and also there is no spare handsets as it’s still on back order.

4 out of 5 stars.,"I've had this for a week now and tried out most features including AR. AR is quite something, I've played a few games including the Machines game that was demo's in the phone showcase by apple and it's really something, scrabbling around on the floor to get the best angles to see my characters shooting up the opponents. FaceID is superior to touch ID in everyway and works in low light/no light. They've done a superb job of it. My one niggle is that I came from the iPhone 6s Plus, if you're used to a larger screen, this is a step backwards in width, height is about right but width is hampered and you notice it. If you can maybe wait for the Plus version next year. All in all though it's a great phone, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. I knocked a star off for the price. Very were fantastic, I pre ordered the phone just after it went live at 8am, think I clocked in at 5 past, delivery was made on release day by Royal Mail.

5 out of 5 stars.,"Having moved from an iPhone 7 Plus i am loving the fact I have slightly larger screen size but a smaller overall size.
The screen is fantastic, crisp text & images, bright colours (even in daylight) and ambient light sensor to adjust the display colour in different lighting settings.
Face ID has been working flawlessly for me and although the lack of home button takes some getting use to after a week I’m not missing it at all.
It’s nice to be able to use my phone one handed again (the plus versions of iPhones were just too big to do this effectively) and the slimmer form factor means it feels less bulky in my front jean pocket.
There’s no doubt it’s a pricey phone, but If you need convincing to buy it then I worked out that I expect it to last me 2-3 years, I use it daily (more than my actual computer) and it will have decent resale value. With all that in mind it will probably end up costing me less than £1 a day (cheaper than a coffee).
And with Very offering interest free Buy Now Pay Later it was just to tempting to miss, so I’d bettet start putting my coffee money into the iPhone saving jar!!

5 out of 5 stars.,"I wanted and wanted for this iPhone X and it was worth the wait. The Style, look and feel is amazing. The Face ID is pretty cool together with Animoji. It’s fun and well designed. The touch screen is quick and easy to use. The phone reminds me of a gadget that could be used in Kingsman or James Bond and it’s so slick and sexy. I would recommend this purchase to you, don’t wait, may be a bit pricey but worth it!!

5 out of 5 stars.,"This iPhone feels like original one but with 10 years advance technology inside. The OLED screen is the best screen Apple as ever produce by far and the Face ID works really well and I wear glasses. Wireless charging is effortless and so is Apple Pay with Face ID, i bought this over 12 months interest free which is why I love Very, no paper work just a few clicks, job done ....

5 out of 5 stars.,"So many great new features with this phone. Apple really have outdone themselves! Love face id, the fact that the phone waits for your face id before displaying messages, animoji, new Siri options etc. Speaker is brilliant also and phone is a nice size and due to it being all screen you can see plenty also. Definitely recommend!
