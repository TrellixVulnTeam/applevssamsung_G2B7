vw.com,galaxy,This phone has several apps that constantly run in the background and the button to disable is greyed out. Also can't force stop. These apps are using data.

vw.com,galaxy,"The amount of internal storage on the Galaxy S9 is impressive. Compared to the 16GB I had with my S5, the 64GB is a welcomed improvement.

vw.com,galaxy,"Everything they say about this phone's technical quality etc. is true. For these aspects, it's probably still the best phone available.

vw.com,galaxy,My camera had many issues . My download to install new update on my phone keep on getting stocked I have call several times to unlock phone due to this issue. S9 to S9 calls is a big issue you can not hear and not able to use bluetooth devices because it makes the connection worse when calling. Yes,2

vw.com,galaxy,"I've heard of many suggestions, some make sense, some don't. I will type this with a real review. I've owed many phones. This s9, not even the plus, is the BEST phone I've ever used. The screen is a vision of beauty. The sound is crisp, clear and the best sounding Galaxy ever. I had my doubts after",5
vw.com,galaxy,"I upgraded from the S8, wasn't sure at first since it looked exactly the same. But I am sooo glad I did. They fixed what didn't work and improved the things that did. I love this phone and think it's the greatest phone on the market!!",5
vw.com,galaxy,"This phone is the best phone I've had in a number of years. It is, in every way better than the Google Pixel 2 XL, that I've had. The speaker, camera, variable flashlight settings, how it handles your photos, the screen, various camera modes(specifically how you can move the shutter button onto the",5
vw.com,galaxy,Love the phone but the only thing I would change is the finish because it is slick and slides  your hand if not holding a little tight. The features are great and love the super slow motion on the camera. It is very easy to transfer apps and contacts from old phone. Had it up and running in,5
vw.com,galaxy,"I love the new sleek design of the phone, the awesome graphics and the great battery life. This phone is by far, is the best phone I have ever had. There are no faults that I can see...I am so happy I waited till this one came out.",5
vw.com,galaxy,I love the sleek design and the fantastic quality of the hardware. Very user friendly interface.,5
vw.com,galaxy,"I've tried multiple phones...iphone 7 plus, note 8, etc...all were too big to be functional. This phone has everything those phones do but in a smaller package. Bold, beautiful screen...plenty of power and battery...but fits in your hand great. It's thin and light. Awesome job Samsung!!!",5
vw.com,galaxy,"I actually switched from a Kyocera Duraforce Pro. I loved that phone, my daughter now uses it. The S9 checks all the boxes as far as features go. This is my first Samsung, I ordered the S8 last year but after receiving it I couldn't get over the placement of the fingerprint sensor, so I sent it back",5
vw.com,galaxy,"I waited , and went from the S7 to the S9. I am glad I did! The S9 is Incredible!!",5
vw.com,galaxy,I have had a Samsung galaxy tablet for some time. It was time to move on from an old I phone. Having a phone that is more user friendly when dealing with documents is a plus.,4
vw.com,galaxy,"I pretty much like this galaxy S9. Don't regret buying it, but I found it a little difficult to use at first. Couldn't ask the store clerk because they were pretty rude so I had to figure out myself. Getting use to it though, the more I discover the more I'm enjoying it. Stay tune",4
vw.com,galaxy,I have mixed reviews of the S-9. There are many short cuts and locations I had come to know and appreciate on the S-6 that are nowhere to be found. I find the touch screen less responsive that the 6 as there are many times on Facebook where I have to touch for more information and it doesn't alway,4

vw.com,galaxy,"I like Samsung phones, I've had them since the S3. This one by far has the best battery life, I can go all day without charging, fairly heavy use, and still end up with about 15 to 20% battery life at the end of the day. Most other things seem about the same as the S7, which was my last phone, exc",4

vw.com,galaxy,"I am really enjoying this phone. Android is Android, but the features that this phone has to offer are awesome. The camera is amazing and all the options in it are really cool. The phone is really slick without a case, so i did purchase one. It is smaller than the iPhone 7+ but it has a bigger s",4
vw.com,galaxy,"Just bought this phone about a week ago. It's a shame that Samsung went exclusively with the Edge screen, as the traditional flat screen was preferred by most users. The Edge Screen makes this phone very sensitive to touch. Even disabling the Edge options does not help. The camera resolution",4
vw.com,galaxy,So far I am happy. I was very disappointed I couldn't get a replacement turbo droid...but we will see if this holds up just as well. I see I have updated icons on text messenger. Still trying to figure things out,4

vw.com,galaxy,"Overall a great phone. I am a little biased because I have been using LG phones for the past 4 years.

Though the Galaxy S9 has some phenomenal features, I still prefer the LG G series devices.",4
vw.com,galaxy,"I got a great deal on this, so was able to upgrade from the S8 to the S9. My S8 was dying quickly after just a year. So far, I'm extremely happy with the phone.

The automatic adaptive brightness doesnt work well seems like its changing",3
vw.com,galaxy,It would be ok if it wouldn't upgrade all the time . And sometimes it will dump your info with you not realizing it. For that I gave it 3 stars. Then the screen protector is a piece of junk. Then when it brakes it cost more today to replace it than it did when I first got the phone 1 year ago. This,3
vw.com,galaxy,"There’s a lot I like about the S9 as an upgrade to iPhone 6 and Galaxy S7 but... screen is fragile and it has inconsistent touch sensitivity.

vw.com,galaxy,its a nice phone. except. the battery life is not as described. ive had my phone for about 6 months. at first the battery life was amazing but now it drains Fast...

vw.com,galaxy,"Just upgraded from my Galaxy 6 which I loved. First and most important- There is no home button and that is driving me crazy. You have to swipe up from any screen or app you are in and it is time consuming and annoying!!! Also password protect doesn't bring up a large number pad, it brings up the",3
vw.com,galaxy,Not a huge fan of the Edge design (but can live with it). Have had two different screen protectors trying to find a pairing that matches the smooth interaction that I had on my S6. Still may have to find another combination. Maybe I hold onto my phones for too long and have too high of expectations,3
vw.com,galaxy,"My main complaint is the battery life, which is less than one day, even with minimal use and minimal apps.

vw.com,galaxy,The phone performance itself is good. The whole Bixby thing is very annoying. The whole curved screen makes it even worse because you can't help accidentally sweeping it when texting. The curve glass screen is a poor design. Even with a case and screen protector I already cracked my screen in less t,3
vw.com,galaxy,"I have mixed feelings on this phone. I mean yes the pretty lilac purple color is so beautiful and the battery is wonderful. But honestly it's a really bad phone.

vw.com,galaxy,"As far as I can see, the only advantage over my S7 is that there is more storage. I should have just bought a bigger SD card. My S7 battery only lasted half a day and my brand new S9 battery only lasts half a day. The S9 has a smaller screen and it is purple but I don't think it was worth buying",3
vw.com,galaxy,"This has a great camera and I have GIF now but sorry I got this. Every time you grab it, the bixby button goes off, it is right there on the side in the middle. I tried to figure out how to just turn the thing off or disabled and can't. I thought my voice texting was bad on the galaaxy 7, worse on",3
vw.com,galaxy,I have always used Android over Iphone. Nice phone but disappointed they removed the ability to assign different tones to text messaging. It was great to be able to assign a different tone so I would know if the message was a work message or not as I work in the medical field and am on call 24/7.,3

vw.com,galaxy,The battery life is horrible and I am not the one who using a lot of apps and is on the phone constantly. I could be on it 30 minutes and it goes from 100% to 60%.
