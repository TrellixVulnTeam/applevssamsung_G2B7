att.com,iphone,"I’ve been with Apple since day 1 of 2007 and the X is by far the best phone to date for sure!! No matter what people are saying about the 7 plus being bigger it’s def not,just read the specs that should be enough right there and all the great new features that come with this phone are fantastic if your due for an upgrade get the X you will not be disappointed,don’t be fooled by the bunk reviews the X is by far the best Phone on the market today!!",5
att.com,iphone,"I went to this from a 6 and no matter what, transfer from one phone to another is never seamless. The biggest thing is no more finger prints! So everything you get into with a fingerprint, you need to remember the password to. I locked myself out of 3 of my accounts. That was a pain, and not every app does facial recognition so be prepared to change passwords, which isn’t a bad thing really. Getting used to swiping everything is easy once you know how and which way to swipe. No home button. But it is easy to forget once you get used to swiping. Battery lasts all day. Big plus. Fast. Bigger plus. I am enjoying getting to know the X.",5
att.com,iphone,"Upgraded from a 3.5 year old iPhone 6. The best thing about this phone is that its overall size is barely larger than my old 6 yet the screen is about 95% the size of my wife's 8+. Larger screen, small package. Face ID is nearly instantaneous. I thought it was a gimmick at first but now that I'm used to it, I don't even think about it. Just pick the phone up, swipe up, and I'm in. I have a 7 for work and when I pick it up, I realize how much I love not having to ever fiddle with the home button--for anything, ever with the X. Screen is amazing. Camera is amazing. I will likely be with this thing for another 3.5 years and I'm fine with that.",5
att.com,iphone,I love how fast this version of iPhone is! But the lack of TouchID makes me realize how much I missed that feature. I may have to get a vertical holder for my car in order to be truly handsfree because the FaceID does not read your face when iPhone is in landscape mode.,4
att.com,iphone,"Surfing the internet is really truly fast almost like using mynhome pc. The text to speech is very accurate. I travel theu the US and the screen does not freeze like people wore claiming. Which was why I waited to upgrade and i travel to places that are -25 degrees. The facial recognition makes it easier to open my phone and you can incorporate it into most apps for ease of use. The camera takes awesome pics and its an all around pretty phone. Big screen enough to watch movies but also compact enough to text with one hand. I Love this phone and it takes care of my personal, financial and work needs. Plus large capacity storage for the size.",5
att.com,iphone,"I was SUPER excite about getting this phone. Pre-ordered it and waited anxiously for it to arrive. When it came and I was able to open it, the size surprised me. It was so small compared to my 7+. After having this phone for about 2 weeks now it leaves a lot to be desired. Most apps don't take up the full screen, leaving a back bar of empty, unused space at the top and bottom, which in turn makes the screen smaller then my 7+. The camera isn't thaatt much better than my 7+. Its thicker and heavier. It seems to be that for what it cost you get a device that leaves a lot to desired. It made me start looking at the Note 8.........",3
att.com,iphone,More hype than substance. While the facial recognition system is nice performance is lacking. Phone connection is not clear. Have many complaints that I can not be heard when calling others compared to my old iPhone 7plus. Despite the hype screen size is underwhelming. Improvement on the top & bottom of screen is ineffective when watching video. Width significantly smaller than iPhone 7+ that impacts reading. (See Photo). Best feature is the camera that allows greater control. Multiple consumer reviews state it is the most breakable phone ever. Finally uying experience was dreadful. Miss days when customer service personal instead of dropped internet connections. Plans that promote free upgrades are worthless when new phones work less effectively than ones they replace.,2
att.com,iphone,"When I saw the first ad for the iPhone X I was like I want that phone. Now that I have had it since the release date I love it but at first I was like oh my what have I done.but I’m happy I stayed with the x. People complain apps are not setup to take full advantage of the x , sadly they knew this going in. Yeah it’s not as big as my 7 plus but you know over all it seems to be a way better phone. The call clarity is amazing. The battery life last a full 2 days for me. The screen is breath taking. And people keep saying the phone is fragile I don’t see it I have dropped mine from waist height about 6 times not even a scratch or crack",5
att.com,iphone,"I’ve been a 10 year Samsung user. I fell in love with this iPhone after a few minutes. I actually just upgraded to a note 8 in November but liked this phone so much that I decided to add a line and get this one. I don’t even touch my note now. Although, it takes me about an hour longer to change my iPhone 10 than It ever did to charge my note. Get the fat charging cube and it will shave some time off of having to wait for a full charge. It’s got a few bugs with compatibility issues, like with he Fitbit, and my gotomeeting call in audio, but other than that I love it. The way to close out of apps is awkward, as well so if they could change that it would be perfect.",5
att.com,iphone,"I can't understand the negative reviews. I have owned every I Phone since their inception. The I Phone X is hands down the best to date. Maneuvering the screen is slightly different but you adjust quickly. The home button is actually an improvement in my opinion. Facial recognition took less then 2 minutes to set up. Additionally facial recognition is quicker and more efficient then the old thumb print on the home button.
Battery life, so far, is outstanding. My other I phones I was charging every 12 hours or so based on my usage. My I Phone X is being charged about every 24 hours. A major improvement, although my results may not be typical. Buy it I don't think that you will have any regrets.",5
att.com,iphone,"Within an hour of getting my phone and setting it up I saw it. There's a 8mm semi-circular crack in my ""gorilla glass"" screen. I didn't notice it at first until I took the phone outside to play with the new camera (which has so many lens flares that are another issue entirely). With the screen illuminated, it's barely noticeable. A phone Of this level should have higher quality standards. I went to the AT&T store and they said they couldn't help me, to take it back to Apple. This is unacceptable in a new product.",1
att.com,iphone,"Just picked up my x on release date i was worried that with a home button i would not like it it. I was wrong it makes life easier especially the face recognition which i was skeptical at first. I really like the touch on my 7+ but face reconition is much faster. Overall this is a big improvement over my 7+ which i thought i was not going to switch but i am glad i did. If you want a smaller phone that will fit better in your pocket with a large screen, faster processor, better camera, faster access to menu then you wont go wrong with the X. Thank you Apple great IPhone",5
att.com,iphone,Apple has done it again. 4K 60fps 4K 24fps no one has this not even super expensive dslr’s. Screen is the best in the industry colors are spot on. I love how it fits perfect in my hand. It is the perfect balance of size and screen realestste. It doesn’t feel overly big tlike the 7 plus did. This phone is a straight monster in performance destroying everything in the market. Face ID is spot on and the gestures are super easy to learn people just don’t like change and complain. Is it worth the money? Yes it is the camera alone is worth the price having all of the shooting options right in your pocket. Well done Apple.,5
att.com,iphone,"I have had iPhone since the first model came out, I upgraded from the 7+ to the iPhone X. I have to say I’ve not been blown away, or even remotely impressed. The new “features” seem to be an attempt to make it seem there was some great changes by simply changing the way things were done, but in a more complicated way. And sorry but you could easily bring the home button back and make everyone happy. I like the size of my 7+ in my hand, personally liked the larger phone. I’m just not really seeing the added value in this phone and find it over rated. I’ve seriously been considering swapping it out for the 8+ and holding out to see if Apply might actually put out another WOW phone soon.",3
att.com,iphone,"Most durable glass ever? I laugh! Attached is a pic of my iphone x right out of the box, i cant speak on anything else as i have not even turned it on.",3
att.com,iphone,Responding to comments from my earlier post. The iPhone X is just to smal especially if you are used to having the plus model iPhones like I have had. Why spend the extra money for Face ID and Animojis??? The new iPhone 8 and iPhone X have just topped the charts as the most fragile smartphones out!!! And they are by far the most expensive to repair. In my opinion they aren’t worth the extra money. I’m a true Apple fan but the new iPhones have let me down so I will be keeping my iPhone 7 Plus and jumping ship to the Samsung Note 8. I have faith that Apple will do the right thing and make a plus sized iPhone X next year but until then I won’t hold my breath,1
att.com,iphone,"Phone is all around incredible. Ridiculous 4K recording. Best battery i have had, better than galaxy s8 plus by a ton",5
att.com,iphone,"I love the screen and clarity. But I’m having a hard time letting go of my iPhone 7+. I thought the camera on the X would be as good, if not better than the 7+ and the flashlight is no where near as bright as my previous iPhones. Not having a button is actually a nice change. I Like the simplicity of swiping to open and close apps. The new iOS is an improved change too. The only issue is moving items around in settings. No one should have to google how to as an email account to an iPhone of they already own an iPhone. Nor should you have to open every tab trying to find where that feature has been moved. Overall, I like the X, but I’m still on the fence about keeping my 7+. I’ve got 11 more days before I have to return it. Hopefully the good will outweigh the bad.",3
att.com,iphone,The phone has a smaller size than other phones with the same size screen. The faceid is what sold me to switch back to an Iphone. It is a game changer for me. I hated to type in a code to unlock the phone everytime I used it. Not having an earphone jack has not been a problem for me. I am disappointed that the phone is much slower to charge than the Samsung S6 I had. The Iphone takes twice as long to charge. I hear the apple is working on a partial solution that will charge at 3/4 as fast as the Samsung. It is not a deal breaker. The new motions to operate the phone have not taken too long to get used to.,4
att.com,iphone,I heard all whistles and bells regarding the IPhone X and was a little bit hesitant of the needs to upgrade from my IPhone 6 plus. Unfortunately I dropped my IPhone 6 plus and now was to make a decision of fixing it or getting a new one so I ordered the new IPhone X. The delivery was fairly fast and by my surprised I was soon to find out that the upgrade was very much noticeable. This phone is the best IPhone ever and do bring a great advantage in the market. this is my experience I do not want to bring technical review but you should do your homework. I chose the 256GB considering that many apps are getting bigger the lower option might not be enough memory by the time I paid your phone off.,5
att.com,iphone,"The phone is larger than all previous iphones, however the screen is more narrow. When I watch landscape video, the screen size expands until it either hits the top and bottom, or the sides, or both (this is normal function), in landscape the video expands until it hits top and bottom and leaves over a 1/2"" of dead screen on each side. this means I am looking at a screen the same size as an old iphone 3 or something. it really really stinks. the narrow screen and resultant small landscape video size is a deal breaker. they can have it back. everyone I show this to is stunned.",1
att.com,iphone,"I switched carriers and the only great deal available was the iPhone BOGO. I have been a loyal Samsung user up until this and switched from the Samsung 8 to the X. I have to be honest, I don’t love it and HATE was the word the first 48 hours. I do like the music options and the camera a lot but other than that I can’t find anything else. Its just difficult to use. The things I could just do before, I have to search for an app now. App after app after app. I hope I will learn to like it but at this point I am counting the hours and minutes until I can get rid of it. If I had any option I would not have this phone.",2
att.com,iphone,The iPhone X is a huge step up from my iPhone 7 Plus and I didn’t expect that. I thought it would just be a nicer screen. But the processor is so much faster. Everything opens and loads instantly. The camera is stunning and the display is the equivalent of my 4K Samsung tv. I was a bit worried with the facial recognition but it works flawlessly. It won’t unlock until you make eye contact and if the phone is ringing it’ll turn down the volume when you look at the phone. Summary? So many fun little features and an amazing processor that never fails. Good Job Apple,5
att.com,iphone,"Upgraded from a 6s. Love the face recognition. Using the phone is different without a home button, but easy to get used to. I had to google a few things like how to shut it down, screen shots, and how to close apps.
The face recognition with Apple Pay is very cool. Face recognition doesn’t work unless your eyes are open and you are looking at the phone. So it feels more private than with the fingerprint scanner.
I chose the silver phone because it looked awesome. But the front and rear of the phone are glass. And it is super slippery. So I looked for a clear silicone case to show off the phone but also keep it safe.
Overall very happy with the new iPhone.",5
att.com,iphone,"Having had every iphone since the first, ands few Galaxy phones as well) I can honestly say that the iPhone X delivered on all fronts. The screen is exceptional to look at. The keyboard seems a little small coming from the 7 Plus. The notch is a non issue during use. Many apps have not optimized for the use of the entire screen and screen dimensions. I think in short term the little quirks will all be worked out quickly by the app developers and Apple. I am very satisfied with the speed of the phone. And the video and picture quality is top notch.",5
att.com,iphone,I was really hesitate on getting the IPhone X because I’m use to the bigger size like the Plus but since I have had the phone I have adjusted and I am loving it. The pictures are soooo clear and amazing I’m glad I went with this phone!!!,5
att.com,iphone,"I truly love the X. I have had many iPhones, and I upgraded from the 7 plus. This is better than any of them. I love the beautiful screen and the face id. It works as well as one would expect from Apple. The design of the phone is gorgeous and the size is perfect. I love the color choices as well. The camera takes fantastic photos and portraits. I’m an Apple groupie I suppose, because I can’t say anything bad about Apple products. The iPhone X is no exception. I’ve loved all my iPhones, and this is my favorite. Thanks, Apple, for such quality products!",5
att.com,iphone,"First: the buying process was painful - waited for nearly an hour for anyone to sell me the product. Then, all they tried to do was upsell, trying to talk me into things I didn't want - terrible.
As for the iPhone X, I like that the screen covers nearly the entire front of the phone. The cameras are great, and there are some other nice features.
On the downside, I would prefer a little smaller overall size - more like the iPhone 7 or 8. Also, the phone gets hot when making a call or other use for more than just a couple minutes.
Definitely overpriced but, I still bought 2 just because I wanted the latest model.",4
att.com,iphone,"I am no average reviewer; I worked as my companies phone manager for over 2 years so I have used every Samsung from S4 up to every iPhone ever made.
Pro’s - Great Display. - Size is perfect. The standard iPhone is too small but the plus is too big. - getting adjusted to no button was easy. - Battery lasts longer. - Animoji’s are cool and I know we will have some cool AR apps that yse this tech.
Con’s - Price is too steep - Fragile phone. Now I haven’t dropped mine but I did see the test on durability and this phone failed. - Lots of apps don’t use the full screen. - The keyboard is still too small. - Auto correct has a glitch in it, and cannot be used. - Animoji’s freeze or don’t work at times. - sound switching is still an issue - Facial recognition doesn’t work all the time. - Siri still isn’t very smart. I asked her what my email address is and she told me she ran into a problem. - Copy and paste still isn’t better than the Galaxy. - Finally price. This phone has an inflated price point.",3
att.com,iphone,"Had a 6 was forced to upgrade to the 7..... the change was.... meh.... the iPhone X is a different animal, heavier... much better looking and with a stunning display that exceeds the size of the 8+.... camera quality is amazing compared to the 7.... people complain about a high price tag when a flagship Samsung is very close .... ;) Apple all the way, quality, finesse and style.... also a phone that will last me 5 years",5
att.com,iphone,"Short and sweet, this is absolutely the best of the best. I love Face ID, the OLED display, 256 Gb, memory, the camera, Animojis,
the size and everything you’ll read in every other 5 star review. IPhone X is a gorgeous phone, it does everything it’s supposed to and fixes are coming super fast for anything it’s not supposed to do which has only been one thing that I can think of. Yes it’s worth the $3.00 more than I paid for iPhone 7 Plus...I have ATT Next and that’s all it comes out to. It’s an awesome phone and I really love it!",5
att.com,iphone,"First off I’ll be an Apple Head forever but the X was for a lack of better terms, a disappointment. I come from the iPhone plus family. And after being used to those phones the size of X was shocking. It’s too hard to get used to a smaller phone after we’ve been accustomed to the size of the plus variety. I recently gave my X back in exchange for the 8 plus. The only difference is the face recognition and the Animoji features. When the X plus comes out I’ll b first in line but for now the 8 plus suits me just fine.",2
att.com,iphone,"As I stated in my first review, the screen is too small on the X, about the size of the iPhone 7. I know the specs say 5.8"", but there is an upper and lower part of the screen that acts like a bezel and is not used. I had to set the AT&T sales people straight and show them the 8 plus has a bigger screen! The keyboard is quite larger on the 8 plus, as it is wider!",3
att.com,iphone,"I am one of those folks upgrading from a plus device (6S plus), so the smaller form factor took some getting used to. The phone is definely narrower but the screen is big and beautiful and to me the size of the phone is perfect. I was mainly concerned that face ID wouldn’t work as well as the finger print reader. It works great! (Makeup, no makeup, glasses on, glasses off, hair up, hair down). It recognizes me and can tell the difference between my daughter and me (we look a lot alike) easily! The phone itself is gorgeous, it’s a shame to cover it up with a case. But it is glass, and I watched all those dropping videos showing how bad they shatter when dropped, so I will definitely use a case. The OLED display is amazing. Colors are definely truer, and black is really really black. I thought the notch would bug me, but it doesn’t. Overall very very happy with the phone and feel lucky to have received it on launch day!",5
att.com,iphone,I love it there is a little learning curve but I love it. It’s a little smaller so it fits in my pocket better without hanging out. The screen size is a tad bigger than the plus without being bigger. The face recognition is wonderful. The colors are much brighter and the speakers are better with more volume. The camera has more features than before. They did a great job with this phone. The only bad thing that I heard about is make sure you have a good case on it cause it doesn’t do well if dropped.,5
att.com,iphone,Love the phone and it’s upgrades however it is so fragile and difficult to find a minimalist drip proof cover to cover all of the front screen including over the raised glass (fragile) to meet where the screen saver ends. I don’t know why Apple chose to design it this way. Also as it is made of glass on front and back I would think more of the aforementioned cases would be available but they are not. I used to love Tech 21 but they don’t fit bc of the front screen design. Also it is so small I have difficulty locating it esp in my purse after using my Uphone 6SPlus and I wish they offered it in the Rose Gold color.,4
att.com,iphone,"While I was ready for an updated iPhone since my 6+ the reviews made me hesitate. All poppy cock! You will not miss the home button or the frame surrounding the screen. In fact, not only do you gain more screen real estate than a plus the iPhone X is narrower and fits easier in the palm of your hand! Furthermore, the face recognition feature is faster and more natural to navigate than the home button. I adjusted to the change in less than a minute. Sexy to hold, navigate and see with a camera/photos that will blow you away. Joy to the world. Thank-you Apple!!! LOVE!",5
att.com,iphone,"I am so in love with this phone! The camera is amazing! If you use the portrait mode under the actual camera app it takes the most amazing pictures! The face recognition is awesome especially to able to use it to sign in to everything on my phone including banking. Another cool feature is that I have ATT home internet which came with an extremely long pointless WiFi password, my friend went to log in to my WiFi the other day and it alerted me on my phone and asked me if I wanted to approve her, then it connected her right away after I hit accept! Such a time saver! Love it and completely worth the money!",5
att.com,iphone,"I came from the 7 plus, the OLED screen and aniemoji interested me highly. Once I got the X, it was a learning curve getting used to no home button and I loved how smooth IOS devices are but this phone I’ve had for about 4 months and I hate how I’m multitasking that it has to reload tasks constantly due to the 3GB of ram. The worse part is when the phone decides to randomly restart every once and a while, the back glass scratches super easy with light use and battery life is ok. I hate the face unlock because I’m the morning it doesn’t recognize you when your on your side laying down and definitely miss the fingerprint reader. I don’t think it was worth the upgrade or 1k price tag so to speak, and I’d say stick with an 7-8 generation of iPhone.",2
att.com,iphone,"I was hesitant on purchasing the new iPhone X, I thought the lack of a home button and the new Face ID would be a disappointment. Days before receiving it in the mail I wanted to cancel My order because I was convinced I would not like it. Every time I used someone else’s x I had trouble understanding its functionality. One day after transferring over the the x I couldn’t be happier. It really is the most amazing phone. Everyone that had one was trying to explain to me how amazing it is but the point is you can’t explain it. You just have to use it. It becomes an extension of you.",5
att.com,iphone,"Having upgraded to every iPhone made since 2002, I was massively disappointed by my experience with the iPhone X. It feels extremely uncomfortable in my hands, and the face rec is literally awful. The battery life is not any better than recent phones, the screen is fine but not a huge step forward, and I can’t reach the entire screen without moving my hands. I’ll be moving back to my iPhone 6s for the time being, and considering my next move. Can’t believe I have to consider another manuf...",2
att.com,iphone,"Used the phone for 2 days after upgrading from the iPhone 6. Unlike the 6, the X gets covered in dozens of micro scratches just being in your pocket without a screen protector on it. The height difference makes this heavier, thicker, top heavy, and more prone to falling out of your hand. Not to mention this is a slippery device to hold without a case and the stainless steel boarder. Most cases for this phone are thicker and wider for more protection since the phone has two large pieces of glass and it’s substatially heavier which means dropping it is going to chip the stainless steel or crack the front and/or the back of the screen. I’m currently using a Spigen case and has improved the grip of the phone. No am/pm for the time next to the notch. No battery percentage next to the notch. No customization options for the notch. On the technical standpoint I’ve had issues with making calls and sharing photos. For the two days that I’ve had the phone. More issues than having the iPhone 6 for two years. I’ve had to restart the phone because of this at least 6 times so far. I wouldn’t expect ATT to send defective phones and have never heard of anyone having to send back defective phones but I feel as though this will be the phone a lot of people return.",1
att.com,iphone,"I was a bit skeptical at first on upgrading to the X for both the cost and some of the new features such as face id. Bought it online though since they advertise free online returns and no restocking fee, figure I'd take a chance and give it a try for a few days. Initial impression was amazing screen and all the features I was skeptical about weren't really a big deal. I was shocked that most of my apps already had FaceID built into them, this was honestly my biggest worry of not having a fingerprint scanner anymore.
Having no home button has taken the longest to get used to but that is a really minor thing and is more so just needing to retrain my muscle memory. Would highly recommend making the jump to this iphone especially if buying online and can return for free.",5
att.com,iphone,I like everything apple and I like this phone. the only reason this isn’t a five start is many because of the fact I like to close apps and it is a pain to do now. I like the facial recognition and not having a home button and some of the new shortcuts they have put in. It is also nice that now it keeps you signed out of everything until it does the facial recognition or password. Same with text and any messages it won’t appear until it does the recognition. So overall it work smooth and I’m starting to get use to how different it is from all of the previous iPhones I’ve had.,4
att.com,iphone,"I hate my new phone. There was no need to remodel everything. The only thing I like is the speed as you slowed everything else down for the older phones. This phone is horrible and very difficult to use. It’s not even the same phone at all. It’s not user friendly and it’s very difficult to do anything. Everything now takes multiple actions to open and close, no just hitting a button to lock your phone and we can’t figure out how to turn it off or close apps. Its a very expensive unusable piece of technology.",1
att.com,iphone,"The iPhone X is really a piece of garbage that is filled with ridiculous and non-intuitive maneuvers. It constantly freezes-up and presents a very frustrating user experience, especially if you are somewhat of an expert using smartphone apps. DO NOT GET SUCKED INTO BUYING THIS!",1
att.com,iphone,"It took me a while to decide if I wanted the IphoneX or the 8plus. A friend of mind explained it this way.. If you like shiny new things and do not mind paying the price for the X then go with that if you want the same phone as your 7 but newer and a bit more updated then go with the 8 plus. Well I like shiny new things and the newest techy things available so I went with the X. I love the camera, the clear crisp pictures it takes. The face recognition is very cool there are other features that I am expressed with as well oh the battery life I find last longer than the Iphone 7 I had. Overall I am very happy so far.",5
att.com,iphone,Phone has a lot of glitches still. AT&T states it’s due to the new operating system. Regret is definitely kicking in...,1
att.com,iphone,This phone looks like every other iPhone out there. No SUBSTANTIAL or EXCEPTIONAL design. Most people cover up any design with a case or cover anyway. The facial recognition works most of the time but not always. The lack of the home button drives me crazy with all the EXTRA swipes now needed. I just don’t she why people love iPhones in general. This will be my last iPhone. It’s time for a phone with real NEW DESIGN and new functionality that doesn’t slow you down like this iPhone X does. Everyone in my family agrees with me on this. We all go back to our 7plus phones if we could.,1
att.com,iphone,"Don’t get me wrong the phone is beautiful but that’s the only good part about it, after a month of use my screen would no longer turn on, had to drive over 3 hours to an apple store just to get it replaced because AT&T doesn’t replace iPhones, got my replacement now another month later my charging port doesn’t work properly and my screen keeps on freezing. This is absolutely ridiculous I wish I never even bought the phone it’s nothing but a headache please be aware",2
att.com,iphone,This Apple iPhone X is my personal and life coaching business phone. I have enjoyed all my iPhones and this one was another excellent choice! The camera is a pure pleasure to use to produce high quality photos and videos. I also take a lot of photos of nature and am amazed at the quality photos I am rewarded with! I love the size of the screen. It’s size is perfect for my hands to hold and operate without tiring. It moves between apps quickly and easily. I’m learning all the amazing secrets of this phone and having a blast!!,5
att.com,iphone,"I have been trying the iPhone X for several days, upgrading from my iPhone 6 Plus. While it has some cute features, there is not enough to justify the price tag. I'm not sure there is enough to justify a lower price tag. The screen is smaller than my previous phone and requires two hands to use most of the time. I am returning the phone to try and find one with the simplicity I enjoyed.",1
att.com,iphone,"This phone is way overrated not to mention costly ! The face recognition is a unique feature however it doesn’t work in the dark , with glasses or sunglasses on , I find myself manually inputting the numeral code to often to unlock the phone , liked the finger print option better . Don’t see much difference in the picture quality than my I phone 6 S or the battery lasting longer . It has 64 GB of memory which was better than 16 GB on 6 S but I think all phones come with that feature now . No buttons to hold to Access Siri is about the only good feature of this but I don’t use Siri enough offset the other items . Last but not least it is more difficult to get out of programs , you have to swipe up , hold then hold the program until a red minus sign pops up then you can get out . I think I paid a whole lot more for there advertising gimmick of some of the features . Would take my I phone 6s any day over this phone .",2
att.com,iphone,"I have been using iphone for about 8 years. This is the best phone ever. I have used samsung galaxy for three times and i switched back to iphone no matter what. The last iphone i had was iphone 8plus. I loved it because of the big screen and fast and stylish. Those plus sizes are so big in my hand. I wanted to try iphone x and got the iphone x. I instantly love it, its small yet its big screen. The weight is light and its easy to hold the phone. However, there is one problem. It freezes!! Sometimes, i called a person and i couldnt hear. I had to turn on speaker to talk. I had to restart the phone to get normal. Sometimes im on web page, its stuck in there. This is the only issue i have. Other than that, this is thr best iphone in iphone generation.",4
att.com,iphone,"Love: - screen almost as big as iPhone8+, but the phone is a bit bigger than iPhone8 - FaceID works really well, and very easy+fast to setup -- much much better than TouchID when it first came out
Hate: With the removal of the Home button, there goes every feature that relied on it. Instead Apple designed new, quirky, cumbersome (to say the least) ways to do the same, except with Horribly Painful user experience. To name a few: - to terminate a running app: * before: double click on Home button, slide app Up to close it - finish in 1 sec * iPhoneX: slide from bottom extremely and carefully and precisely (if not, you get something else!!!) until you get what you want, THEN, press-hold the app for at least 1sec until a f*cking Delete button appears, THEN, touch the Delete button - to see All running apps: this is a similar ordeal. - to use Touch: NONE. This feature NO LONGER exists - to use FaceID to allow App purchase (or other things) * before: just press-hold touch for about 1sec * iPhoneX: must press Power button twice, and REALLY QUICKLY!!! (to avoid turning of screen) - since the button is on the side, this becomes extremely hard to do with just one hand!
Overall: I'd rather get iPhone7/8/9 Plus. With the iPhoneX, I think they walked 5 steps forward only to go 10 steps sideways - ie, all-in-all, they've made almost 0 (or Backward!) progress in making the X ""better"".
If you can leave with the serious limitations and loves past iPhones, then this is for YOU. If you loved iPhone before, stay with the 7/8/9/etc. If you never used iPhone, Do NOT get the X.",1
att.com,iphone,"This IS the most beautiful, fluid, high-quality smart phone I’ve ever owned. There are a few new things to learn if you’re a previous iPhone user, but within a day or two, it was almost second nature. I picked up my wife’s iPhone 8, and without thinking, started using iPhone X gestures. Some ppl have complained about losing the home button or finger print ID, I don’t miss them. You don’t loose more than a second from the previous version to see opened apps and close them- which was one gripe I read. If you are part of the Apple ecosystem and are ready for the next gen tech type instead of the same old stuff— this is it!",5
att.com,iphone,I was really EXCITED about the X until the day i actually received it and called it my VERY own. However I’m not at all excited as I was when it launched. Coming from a 7 Plus to the X is a highly dissatisfaction to me. I just can’t seem to adjust to this SMALLER version phone. I’m trying my best to stick with it but it is so hard. My fingers seem to cramp holding on to this phone. The screen definitely doesn’t seem to be a 5.8 screen that’s for sure. I’m definitely considering returning the X for and 8 plus until they consider a X PLUS!! If the X body was the fit of the Plus I would highly recommend it but if your coming from a PLUS to the x you better highly think “TWICE” before your purchase because it’s definitely a hard adjustment.,1
att.com,iphone,"I had the 8Plus and even though they technically have the same internal workings, it’s certainly not the same phone. It’s truly something new for Apple. I’m in love with this phone and couldn’t say any more good things about it.",5
att.com,iphone,The phone has so many issues. It freezes. The touch sensor goes out so when that happens there’s no access into your phone. ATT has been zero help. This occurred 2 days after I purchased my phone and they will not fix it or exchange it. It lags. There’s just better quality phones than this one.,1
att.com,iphone,"My iPhone X screen becomes unresponsive immediately when I walk outside into cold weather, good luck typing or navigating phone. Phone advertises as being a larger display, but the aspect ratio is way off.. videos look very small and cropped, and when using zoom to watch videos full screen it cuts off a lot of the picture.. other than those two issues the phone is amazing. Those are pretty big issues though especially for the high price tag.",2
att.com,iphone,"If you are an avid iPhone user you will love this phone! I takes about a day or so to get use to the new gestures and the absence of a home button, but once you become familiar with the new setup...its off to the races. Even though this phone is smaller than the plus models, the screen is much bigger and I love it. The capability of the phone (especially the 256 gig) is outstanding. I won't even attempt to describe its entertainment value, as my words couldn't come close to doing it justice. All I can say is, just upgrade to this phone and you won't be disappointed.",5
att.com,iphone,"I bought the X back in December and ended up returning it a week later. While the design is nice, there wasn't anything amazing that it did over my 7 Plus. It just felt like another iPhone. Nothing new. I don't really need the animoji feature. The edge to edge screen was nice, but in reality when viewing media, it displayed the videos in a smaller viewing than the 7 Plus. It was average, for me. I'll see what Apple has in store for the fall.",3
att.com,iphone,Just got my X this is the greatest phone ever have had new iPhones since 2007 finally they gave us what we wanted,5
att.com,iphone,"I am not that please with this phone. It doesn't keep the settings as designated. When I take a photo and try to send it via text or email, it gets hung up in the ""To"" field. This has happened at least a dozen times and I've had my phone for 5 lousy days. I then have to reset the phone everytime. When I had my i-Phone 6, it would automatically connect to my wi-fi and come....on the phone, I have go into settings and log in every time.",3
att.com,iphone,I'm really disappointed on how small this phone is considering that I've been so use to my 7 plus! They really fooled a lot of us with that but other than that it's okay I like the Face ID and camera/features are better! Hopefully next year we get a Iphone X plus lol,3
att.com,iphone,"I sincerely dislike this phone. Easy to navigate after a day or so. Biggest deciding factor was that it's difficult getting used to screen size going from 6plus. I understand X is ""bigger"" measuring diagonally, however I rather the wider (plus devices) for easier viewing/reading. Also, facial recognition sometimes works & sometimes doesn't. On speaker phone speaker sometimes will sound strained if loud sound comes thru call. Lots of missed calls even after making sure sleep mode is off...I think it's something to do w speaker. With brightness turned all the way up there appears to be overcast on screen in sun. Phone was really just not a good fit for me personally. Was expecting way more with this price tag. Transfering this phone to a family member ASAP. Just not worth the hype.",1
att.com,iphone,My iPhone X is good battery. I love my wallpapers. I have a 256gb.,5
att.com,iphone,I was talked out of the iPhone 8 Plus for the I phone X don’t do it. The face view barely works and the missing home button is frustrating. The phone freezes never had these issues with the other I phones.,1
att.com,iphone,Ever since Apple released a plus version of their phones I’ve owned one and never saw myself going back to the reg size or version. But honestly I have to daub i love this phone it is flawless at least for me no issues yet! iOS is real smooth and snappy. Although iPhone XS Max has been released its an S versión sob i am not in no rush to get the plus with really minor upgrades mostly in the camera area if you really compare them. I’ll see and wait for the next big thing. But anyone thinking of getting this phone coming from an older gen I really recommend it.,5
att.com,iphone,"Maybe I got a lemon, but the phone is completely unusable after less than a week of ownership. Screens switch back and forth at will and apps randomly open and close. I've read it could be from the screen being put on incorrectly at the manufacturer. For this much money, it should work!",1
att.com,iphone,"I absolutely love this phone !! I wasn’t planning on getting it but when I saw it in person and played with it my jaw dropped . Absolutely amazing !! Super easy to use . I thought I wouldn’t get used to not having the home button , the thought scared me but it’s super simple to go back home. The screen is huge! The battery life is super long . Super clear videos , and the pictures WOW Amazing!!!! I love it !!! Best purchase ive made!!",5
att.com,iphone,"I was really excited when I ordered this phone but such a disappointment. its really glitchy, freezes all the time, disconnects calls all the time amongst a lot of other things. been on the phone with customer service a few times with a few trips to the Store. I dont know what else to get since I've been an advocate for these products for the longest time and sadly this is the first time I just can't. going again to the Store this Sunday so this is getting very annoying.",1
att.com,iphone,I HATE this phone!!! The face recognition sucks needs to have finger print as a back up especially since you can only have one face. When I delete emails they come back into my inbox like 2 seconds later. The buttons are directly across from each other so I’m continually screenshoting things. They have added multiple steps to do virtually everything. This phone is NOT user friendly at all! Oh and did I mention how slooowwww it is! I want my 7plus back!,1
att.com,iphone,"At first the phone was great , great quality photos as always. But the phone gmstatyrd glitching a month after I purchase. It always glitches and it gets worse as the phone gets warm from either the sun or from under a pillow. I’m down grading to the iPhone 8.",1
att.com,iphone,"First of all.. This phone is absolutely stunning to look at. The craftsmanship and attention to detail and materials used are just perfection. Secondly, I thought I would miss the home button (have had Iphones for several years). I forgot all about the home button within 5 minutes of using this device. The gestures and swipes used in place of the home button are natural and intuitive and not at all hard to learn. In fact, I think it is much faster on this phone without the home button. Thirdly, face ID is flawless. Works every time, morning or night. Fourthly, the oled display is gorgeous. I could go on and on but I won’t. Simply put... buy this phone if you want THE BEST!",5
att.com,iphone,I'm a woman with long hair... sometimes I wear it up and other times it's down. So there were times when it didn't recognize me. So I'd have to move my hair and head all around for it to open the phone and would end up having to put in my code half the time. So much for that! So when I returned it for an 8 they told me they never heard of anyone else having the issue and charged me a restocking fee! I could have gotten another X but why relive that annoyance twice?,2
att.com,iphone,This is definitely not the best iPhone released phone is very glitchy and buggy and could be a lot better. There is no way to really do anything if it freezes because there is no more home button,1
att.com,iphone,"I checked reviews before I purchased this phone, and almost hesitated and bought an 8 instead after reading complaints about new swiping functions and the removal of the home button. After a little over a week of use, I can’t think of anything negative to say about it. The changes are very easy to adapt to and user-friendly, and definitely a huge upgrade from my 6s. The camera and sound are amazing, and I haven’t encountered any problems or glitches. On top of how easy and fun the phone is to use, it also looks great! There is still more to experiment with, but so far I am very happy with it.",5
att.com,iphone,I’ve always had iPhones ! But this one is my fav !! I love it so much ❤️ Its super fast ! The camera is the BEST ! Front Facing Portrait is literally awesome!! Everything about it is Great ! Highly recommended!,5
att.com,iphone,"My phone phantom texts often. Buttons will randomly be pushed or it will open apps, text messages or mark work emails as read before I see them. Sometimes I pick up my phone and I’m locked out for 5 minutes. Cleaning they screen, resetting the phone to factory settings and buying a case have barely helped. Regretting the purchase.",2
att.com,iphone,"If you like the size of the plus phones then the X is too small; it doesnt matter that the screen is “bigger”. Every task requires so many extra steps (closing apps, looking for icons such as Do Not Disturb). Face ID is super inaccurate. Overall, it is an expensive phone and not worth it. I will most likely exchange for the 8plus.",2
att.com,iphone,Not real impressed. Camera isn’t that great and apps keep locking up.,1
att.com,iphone,"I was really excited to get this phone on pre-order until I actually received. After a few weeks with it I decided to return it. The ""full"" screen is obviously not full screen and that notch at the top will drive you nuts. Face ID doesn't work quickly and about 80% of the time you'll end up typing in your pass code anyways.
When making calls I was told that it was extremely difficult to hear me and like I was underwater. You have to hold the phone right in front of your mouth for people to be able to hear you. If you hold the phone 1-2+ inches away it will be extremely difficult for others to hear you.
I was moving from my iPhone 6s and really miss having a headphone jack. It's the times when you get to the gym or are at work and want to listen something and don't have the dongle or Apple supplied headphones.
On top of the design flaws of this phone it was also really glitchy. My apps and folders opened a lot slower than they did on my 6s. I wasn't able to make calls one day until I restarted the phone. Sometimes the flashlight wouldn't work at all, no matter how many times you tapped it.
The one pro that I will mention was the battery life, which was the main reason for my switch from my old 6s. The battery lasted all day while using multiple apps.
When I paid the hefty price for the phone I was a little weary because that's a lot for a phone, but I was fine with it. A phone is an investment in your everyday life. But when I received this purchase I expected to be amazed and definitely was not. Overall, I would not purchase this phone again and after years of buying countless Apple products-Apple Watch, Apple TV, Macbook Air, iMac, iPad Pro, iPhone..... I'm sad to say that I'll be giving Android a good look for my next phone.",3
att.com,iphone,I love the new fave recognition but have found many times I have to lift my phone up and literally stare at it to get it to open. I feel like people are wondering what I am doing! I do the love it for savings passwords and then opening them up! I also strongly dislike the sos feature! It is where you hold down both buttons in both sides of the phone and it calls 911. Terrible feature as I have accidentally done it three times since I had it (2weeka ago)! Not sure if That’s a feature hat be turned off but I will if I can! Still getting used to the no home button too but it’d not do bad!,4
att.com,iphone,"I like the smaller size than the plus, and no home button is good. But other than that the phone is just ok.
- turned “True Tone” off. Display looks too yellow otherwise. With it turned off, it looks too “cool blue.”
- do not like Face ID. Wish there was a fingerprint sensor instead. Ended up just turning it off which makes my phone less secure because I don’t want to enter a password either.
- why is the power button so big? I end up taking a screenshot or sleeping the screen every time I turn the volume up or down. Why place these buttons directly opposite each other?
These are kind of big things that annoy me when it comes to a phone because they are huge parts of using a phone.",3
att.com,iphone,Over the past two weeks -the new AT&T iPhone X has worked fine - unless you need a GPS map display and it's hot outside. Three times in past week screen goes dim when running Maps or Google Maps for GPS directions. Screen dims to point where you cannot see map at all.,1
att.com,iphone,I wish for the large unreasonable price it came as a PLUS. Needs to be thicker and it is very slippery. The button is close to the up and down volume that when you grab it your hand touches both side and then you can't turn it off and instead adjust the volume. Not made for large finger. I am getting used to it. The facial pass is great and colors and graphics are great. It runs fast. A little slow on downloading apps and moving email around. I miss being able to listen to music at work because I can not charge it at the same time. Ask me for more in a few months. LOL,4
att.com,iphone,"I made the jump from a 7plus, and haven’t looked back. It took me about a day to get used to the new gestures that are used in place of the home button, and now, when I use my wife’s iPhone 7, it feels totally unnatural. I’m impressed with the battery life, the screen, the camera, pretty much everything. To me, the only downside is the price... Apple should have found a way to make it cost a couple hundred dollars less. Editing to remove specific mention of the price, because apparently not everyone knows how much the iPhone costs, and its against AT&T policy for me to mention it here.",5
att.com,iphone,I’m very disappointed with this phone. I had the phone for less than 10 day and it stop working. I was unable to turn phone on. I took it to the store 3 times 2 sales rep tried troubleshooting phone-they were unsuccesful.,1
att.com,iphone,"So to start with, don’t get me wrong, it’s a beautiful phone. However, for the price point, it was way overpriced. If you have an iPhone 7 or 7+ then truly the upgrade is not worth it
I had an issue with my 7+, but I wasn’t real happy with, so this was a forced upgrade.
So quite frankly, I don’t think it’s worth enough bread for my iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. I would probably wait a year.",3
att.com,iphone,"Still playing w/it. However, I can say that I miss the home button. Don’t really care for the side button function. But will see, I’ll give it a little more time.",5
att.com,iphone,"The iPhone X is great so far, only one crazy glitch, the volume turns up on it's own after about 5 minutes of listening to music. Does it every time, volume just doubles all by itself...???",4
att.com,iphone,"Phone is good, but am having software issues where the lock screen goes blank without showing time or pass code. I have to restart everytime this happens. There is no way to resolve it yet",2
att.com,iphone,"what an amazing iphone this is, i believe its the android killer iphone X is the best thing since sliced bread its the best ever period lightning fast the pictures the video is stunning love the new ring tone... iphone X is so much better and smaller with bigger screen thank you and love you Apple",5
att.com,iphone,The Bluetooth is problematic. One should not have to search for solutions to a problem on YouTube when you have a new phone. iPhone consistently declines in quality and reliability,2
att.com,iphone,Phone reception is horrible with one bar. You can hear the person but they cannot hear you.. works fine with 2 bars. I did not have this problem with the iPhone 5,3
att.com,iphone,"The phone is average. Photo clarity is wonderful, however my phone keeps freezing at the home screen which throws me for a loop. Overall it’s average to other iPhones.",1
att.com,iphone,"Small usable screen compared to the iPhone 7 Plus. Poorly thought out design (notch, control center, etc.)",2
att.com,iphone,I thought the X was going so be a significant upgrade from my 7Plus. I was told over by the customer service/sales dept that the the X was the same size as the 7plus and that it had much better features. They also told me that all iPhones are moving towards getting rid of the home button and that getting the x would get me used to navigating without it. I can’t stand this phone... it’s significantlh smaller and as far as the upgrades from the 7s... I really can’t tell any difference and the no home button is annoying! I’m hoping I can still exchange,2
att.com,iphone,"I used to be a huge iPhone fan back in the early iPhone days. My last iPhone I liked was the 4S and I felt they got worse from there. I spent the last few years using a galaxy phone and loving them. The iPhone X is the first iPhone to bring me back to apple and actually Be satisfied in years! It’s very fast, the screen is finally on par and it holds a great charge.",5
att.com,iphone,Pre -ordered on launch day -rc'd earlier than original prediction. Was very excited to begin using. Reality check! Screen was scratched right out of the box! How durable is this phone going to be?! Have had many previous iPhones that didn't scratch after having for years. Needless to say had to return. I am seriously considering not getting another & sticking with my 7 plus.,1
att.com,iphone,"I switched carriers so I decided to upgrade and went with the X. I was a little worried that I would miss my finger print, but so far I am very happy with the Face ID. I love the animal emjos. The camera is by far the best camera you could ever want on a phone. Learning the new gestures did take a few days to get use to and even after three weeks I’m still getting use gesturing. I love the size it’s not too small and not to big like the plus. Overall it is a very nice phone and worth the money. I came from iPhone 7 and 8 plus and I’m very happy I took a chance on the X.",5
att.com,iphone,"Pros: Phone design is good
Cons: Face ID doesn't work all the time. But, when it works it is extremely fast Videos doesn't come in full screen Hard to resist to not press home button if you have been an iPhone user all along Lot of bugs in this release",3
att.com,iphone,I love the iPhone X other than it’s size. I am a diabetic and can not see very well. The IPhone 7 Plus with large bold text was perfect for me. I can barely see to use my X even with glasses. Unfortunately this is a disappointment to me because there isn’t a PLUS option for those with difficulty seeing well like myself.,3
att.com,iphone,"The phone itself works great! It is just what any iPhone user would expect. HOWEVER, it is so fragile! I always use a screen protector and I throroughly research good cases for my phones. Still, the glass on the back of the phone broke almost immediately, and the cost to repair it without Apple care is ridiculous. I don’t know who had the idea to put the glass on the back of an iPhone, but firstly, it was a bad idea, and secondly, they should have warned us about the fragility.",2
att.com,iphone,"People can talk about how Samsung has been the pioneer of new advancements in next gen phones; that might be true, but you can’t compare to Apples reliability and durability of their phones. I’m contastantly asked to use my phone because an app/battery doesn’t not work on a Samsung phone.
The iPhone X is a beautifully design phone. The battery/processor/camera stand out. I was skeptic about the Face ID, but I love the fact I can just log in to anything with just my face.",5
att.com,iphone,"Bottom line first- I like the iPhone X, I don't love it. My primary negative comment is the screen is not as large as my 6s Plus, no way! The X screen is SLIGHTLY longer but THINNER. The screen configuration results in the keyboard and characters being much smaller requiring anyone with normal sized fingers to turn the phone sideways to type. Most of the screen is not used by webpages and most apps and as a result you still have the border top and bottom. Apple says vendors will adapt, who knows? Face recognition, Apple Pay etc. work great and the processor is the fastest yet. Battery life is not spectacular either. The new gestures take a while to perfect but it is not a big deal to learn. I still prefer the home button to the constant need to swipe up on the new X. Phone is pricey so think twice as bang for the buck may be slightly lacking. All in all, my 6s plus is just as good, just not as fast.",4
att.com,iphone,"I had high hopes for the long awaited iPhone X. I must say that I am disappointed with lack of new features. The only new feature is the Face ID and perhaps standard camera upgrade. Otherwise there’s nothing much different than the 6, 7 or 8.",2
att.com,iphone,"The iphone x is unique in its own way. It is a step away from the ""classic"" layout, look and feel for iphones. I've heard a mix of good and bad things about this phone specifically. The features on this phone are all what they are made out to be. The face ID is absolutely mind blowing and it one of the easiest things to use. This phone is compatible for wireless charging which is so nice for us lazy people. It is bigger than the iphone 8, yet smaller than the plus. It has portrait mode on both front and back cameras, which makes the picture quality amazing. I really thought that not having a home button would bother me, but since i've had this phone for a while now i don't think i could ever go back to a home button.",5
att.com,iphone,"The X truly has the “x” factor. It is seemlessly comfortable to use. Smooth and fluid to the touch and each gesture reflects similar haptic responses. I would say this is the best iPhone I have ever owned. Having last the 7 plus I was worried that the size would be a negative impact, it is not. the screen is larger and yet so much easier to hold and interact with. The length of the screen is great when reading articles and beyond texting I seldom have to use two hands. The experience transports you back to age ten atop your bike ripping down the tallest hill in the neighborhood, well you get The drift. It’s easy, fun, and reminds you that things will always get better, but most importantly enjoy the experience “now!”",5
att.com,iphone,"I got the IPhone X when I switched to at&t. The battery life only lasts around 7-9 hours if you constantly use it. The price isn’t worth it either considering the XR is better and cheaper. Otherwise, the camera and Face ID are great and overall it’s a good phone. Would recommend to get an XR.",3
att.com,iphone,"This is a beautiful phone. It’s not really an issue that there is no home button or headphone jack, as swiping up from the bottom works perfectly to take you home, and Apple includes earbuds that plug into the lightning charger port in case you don’t have wireless headphones. The glass back, front screen with curved sides, and bigger picture all make this a beautiful object, though because it is so incredibly expensive, you will probably want to put it in a case and put on a screen protector, which will compromise its beauty. The camera also takes gorgeous photos.",5
att.com,iphone,"The iPhone X is amazing in every aspect! If you're worried about the notch at the top, it disappears after getting used to. A lot of people will complain about the price but get over it, if you can afford it, get it. End of story! I do recommend a case for it as it is all glass.",5
att.com,iphone,AT&T do a great job when I land in the Store Is full of opportunities for get your Apple gadgets.,5
att.com,iphone,"Not having a home button takes a little getting used to, but after just a few hours, it felt comfortable. We bought an Iphone 8 at the same time and getting it set up using the home button felt awkward and clunky compared to the X. Also, facial recognition is much more of a big deal than I thought it would be. Just having to look at the camera rather than use a fingerprint is much more convenient. Concerns that I had read about problems with the recognition working at angles or in total darkness turned out to be non-issues. Battery life could be better - a lot better, really - but I'm able to get a full day of heavy use out of it, so it hasn't been that big of an issues for me. Overall, I'm very happy with the phone.",5
att.com,iphone,"After using it for a week, I’ve discovered that I miss several aspects of the IPhone 7 Plus. Miss the battery percentage being available on the top right corner without having to swipe. Miss the home button and it’s double click features. Miss the full screen without the camera affecting the view amongst other small but significant things.",3
att.com,iphone,"The phone gets some getting use to but all in all it’s spectacular. My only complain would be how slippery it is, it literally slides of everything even on my wireless charger it’s seems to just slide off on its own. If it wasn’t for that I would give it 5 stars",4
att.com,iphone,"On you tube you can’t get full screen , and many other applications , this phone is good to upgrade from the 7 not from the 7 plus they should have made x plus",1

att.com,iphone,"The phone works good, my only issue with this phone is the size of the screen. The screen on the X is about the same size as standard iphone 7! Why am I paying more money for a phone that has smaller usable screen area than my old iphone 7 plus? I will be returning this phone and getting an iphone 8 plus! This is the most disappointing iphone yet! I will keep my 8 plus, until they make a X-Plus!",3

att.com,iphone,Galaxy killers lol Best phones,5
att.com,iphone,Amazing camera features!!,5
att.com,iphone,"What can I say? State-of-the-art device that leaves the competition in the dust! It’s everything you expect in an iPhone and more. Facial ID is the bomb while screen size is (in my opinion) optimal though smaller than the iPhone 8. I say optimal because at some point in the evolution of smart phones as the screens get progressively larger the device ceases to be a phone and becomes a tablet or mini-laptop. If you want a phone buy an iPhone X. If you want a tablet (or larger) then buy that type device and “enjoy” lugging that around. As for me, the iPhone X is easy to see with unmatched clarity, and is easy to carry on your belt or in your pocket (or anywhere else you desire) without toting some sort of “brick” around with you.",5
att.com,iphone,I upgraded from the 6+. I was always running out of storage so I was super excited to see that this phone came with more storage and I don’t have to purchase additional storage from Apple. The phone size is great. It’s not as big as the 6+ and fits in my back pocket nicely. The new emoji option is fun. The camera takes amazing photos and I love the selfie option it gives you multiple lighting options and there is an option to make comments on your pictures before you send them. The battery is also great it lasts all day even with excessive phone use.,5
att.com,iphone,Only purchased this phone a week ago and already having problems. My screen went flashing green and is frozen. I can not use it and AT&T will not help me they said it's an Apple problem. Very disappointed!!,1
att.com,iphone,"I have to admit that I went in with a negative attitude for the iphone. I went and got the first iPhone when it came out and I hated it. I was back at ATT within a week to get another android. Fast forward, I was intrigued by the IPhone 6 plus, so I tried it and again I needed my android so it went back. Now the IPhone X comes on scene, I decided to give it a shot. Mainly because my beloved androids lacked internal memory and 256gb sounded awesome. Yes, I am aware you can install an SD Card but they have locked the card so that it cannot be used for apps. My internal memory on my S7 was full and I had over 100gb on my SD Card that I could only use for pics, vids, and music. Way to go Android, expandable memory my butt. Anyway, back to the IPhone X. I was really concerned about losing my customization options like my widgets and my apps. I have had this phone for a few days now and I can honestly say that I am so happy I gave it a shot. I had my ringtones on it in a few minutes, and I have made more. Yes, you do have to use ITunes to do that but it really does only take a few minutes. I only found one of my apps that was not available on iPhone but I got another that does everything that app did. The Camera's on this phone are amazing and I really love the face ID. I transferred all my music over and after I transferred everything from my S7 over I still have over 200gb of internal memory left. I really do love this IPhone, that is something I was not planning on doing. The phone is gorgeous and I hate covering it with a case but I plan on having this phone for a long time. Good job Apple, and Android...get your game on or a lot of other android users will be saying goodbye.",5
att.com,iphone,"I went from an iPhone 7 Plus to the X. I was skeptical because it was smaller, the face recognition was different for me, and no home button. However my mind was changed within the first week of using the X. It’s more streamlined, faster, clearer screen, the audio is killer, and the face recognition is saving time. I went back and forth the first week with whether or not I should change to the 8 Plus and now I’m so glad I didn’t!",5
att.com,iphone,"I was a little hesitant on the idea of no home button, however it is easily something that I got used to not having. Pretty much, I feel like the phone is still very similar to the 7-8 models which are great overall in my opinion anyways. I did go from the 7plus to the xphone and it is very small compared to plus for sure and that takes some adjusting to in handling the phone, etc. It's camera quality is also similar to the 7plus but there are added filters and such with the new xphone. I do not feel like I will be disappointed in my upgrade at all !",5
att.com,iphone,This is the best iPhone yet people complained when the plus sized phones came out and now they complain when it's more hand friendly I think people just like to complain the X has way better features then any Samsung and 8plus the 8 only has a LCD display the X has oled which is WAYYYY BETTER deeper blacks brighter whites and colors plus it has a bigger screen then the 8plus which is amazing,5
att.com,iphone,"I phone x has nice camera in front and back, but the face identification dosenot work perfectly. LG V30 works better. Identifying your voice as command is worst. Unlocking is hard. It is heavy in hand. I did not like. I returned that. I got LG v30. It is very more responsible than iphone X.",1
att.com,iphone,"Overall I enjoy my new phone, I switched from an IPhone 6 so I have a lot of catching up to do. I don't really like that I cannot listen to my headphones and traditionally charge my phone at the same time. I also am not a fan of having to keep up with the head phone adapter so I can use my head phones on my MacBook. I like being able to easily swipe between applications and the larger screen is definitely a perk.",5
att.com,iphone,The phone is smaller than my 7 plus but the screen is larger. So far I love it. YouTube videos can been seen full size you just need to swipe the screen from inside out to widen it to full screen. The X is fast and the facial scan works great so far.,5
att.com,iphone,It’s really not worth the money. I myself miss my iPhone 7. The battery really sucks on the iPhone .,1
att.com,iphone,This phone felt weird at first but it felt better after every hour of owning it. It’s amazing!!!,5
att.com,iphone,"I was initially disappointed because although he screen size is 5.8, it’s narrower than the Plus’ 5.5 screen. I did adjust to the minor loss of width, and actually appreciate how much better the X fits in my hand, and my pockets! The Plus was a monster that didn’t fit anywhere. I bought the X despite it having Face ID and no Touch ID, but I quickly fell in love with Face ID! I especially love that Face ID does not show notification previews until I unlock it with my face; I no longer need to place my phone screen down to prevent other people from seeing my texts.
The screen is stunningly beautiful, especially when watching movies or videos. I hated the notch before I bought the phone and thought I’d end up returning it because it would annoy me that much but my fears were unfounded. I don’t really notice the notch much anymore, primarily because it’s above the reading area.
I could go on and on about this phone but I’ll stop now :) Great job Apple!
P.S. Battery life could be better. I do miss the battery life of the Plus but I wouldn’t go back to it.",5
att.com,iphone,No big deal. Same as others and not worth the big $$$$$,3
att.com,iphone,"The one issue i have... I keep taking screen shots! In order to wake the phone up, you have to press the side button- which is you hit the volume and that together- takes a screen shot! and that, is annoying as all heck. Otherwise, the phone is beautiful. easy, seamless, and the display is truly WOW. also, it continually amuses me that i don't have to freak out if i get it slightly wet. like, my hands are wet form dishes, etc. its really nice to know that you don't have to worry!",4
att.com,iphone,"I’m in love with the iPhone X! The new design is so amazing. I love the phone size, as the plus was getting a little large for my liking. This one is much more manageable for one handed use.",5
att.com,iphone,"It’s hard to use. Specifically, I find difficult: Taking screen shots, turning it off, I don’t like swiping up instead of having a home button, the size -it’s too big to hold in one hand.",1
att.com,iphone,"At first sight, the well known notch design appears to be highly unattractive. However, once the device is in hand, you begin to notice it less often. The fact that one can hold their smartphone in one hand again without sacrificing screen real estate is fantastic! The new iphone X feels and is premium all around! The new OLED display provides a rich and vibrant viewing experience without emitting overly saturated colors, camera technology is out of this world, speed is completely insane, and the battery life is much better than expected! Sure, the iphone X isn't perfect in every way possible but is indeed a step in a new direction; revolutionary. This is by far the best iphone to date and I'm sure it's only going to keep getting better! -Harmonious",5
att.com,iphone,Had my phone less than a week. Frozen home screen while out of town. Tried to reset it and it called 911 and could not hang up. Very upset and frustrated along with a big Disappointment.,2
att.com,iphone,"Just one word, Amazing , great design ,great Screen, loved the new improved OLED screen, Camera captures the intricate details , high resolution pictures and videos . Face ID works smoothly , easier than Touch ID to setup. Animoji is fun. Moving towards the future, this iPhone upgrade is definitely worth it . Apple has always been an innovator. Great Product. Hands Down iOS.",5
att.com,iphone,"I recently pre-ordered the iPhone X 256 GB on October 27th. It shipped on November 7th. I was so excited about the phone that I picked it up from the post office. I took the box to AT&T store and it was activated right out the box.
Let’s get to the point, the phone is very nice, sleek, and sexy. It the Face I.D works just as good as Touch ID if not better. The technology they put into making this device is extremely powerful and accurate. This is the iPhone I’ve been waiting for since 2007.
The camera on this phone is superb and does so many different things. Facial recognition is even tied into your emojis which is nice.
The battery life on this phone actually is very good. It last me the entire day and some with moderate to heavy usage.",5
att.com,iphone,"I have to admit, I was very scared ordering this phone. I went as far as making my husband promise he would give me his 7 plus if I didn’t like the X. I have to say I love this phone. I upgraded from the 6s plus. It is smaller which I actually like because I find it easier to handle. The facial recognition was the scariest part for me. I was afraid I would miss the thumbprint for accessing the phone and most of my apps. Truthfully, I don’t. The facial recognition is much better by far. The apps that I would access using my thumbprint, I now access using the facial recognition. There are many pluses over my previous phone. Much smooth movement throughout the phone. The screen is much sharper. Definitely a great phone that I am recommending to everyone.",5
att.com,iphone,"It was worth waiting in line for two hours to get this phone. I love all the features, it runs smoothly and fast. Although I do wish the screen was a little bit bigger. I’m really into big screens and this screen seems to be not much of a big difference from the iPhone 7+ and iPhone 8+ phones, but other than that the iPhone X has lived up to the hype. I love it!",4
att.com,iphone,I just began getting my credit back together when I came by the store and next thing I know I’ve gotten the Newest IPhone and I’m so thankful to not just have the X but I’m with a reliable company who works with their customers!!! Hence why not only do my children have Apple as well but I’m also the proud owner of the Apple Watch and AirPods.. hopefully soon a Ipad,5
att.com,iphone,This is the best iPhone yet .. I switch from android to get this phone.. I really hope the rumors of apple killing this phone aren’t true.. the build quality and the weight of the phone is perfect .. the edge to edge screen is super beautiful.. att ship my order really fast and had it the next aftertnoon thank you att and Apple I can’t say enough about this phone,5
att.com,iphone,"Apple would have you believe that this is the greatest smartphone ever, with the largest screen of any iPhone. But that's not quite true. Measured diagonally, X has a 5.8"" screen versus the 5.5"" of the 8S. But you have to knock part of that off because the ""horns"" are unusable space in your apps. What you end up with is a screen that is slightly taller than the 8S, but also slightly narrower. You have virtually the same amount of screen. Unfortunately, watching video in full screen leaves a section cut-out on the side or the other option is to center the video, giving you a much smaller viewing area with black bars on all four sides than if you were watching the same video on the 8S.
The build of the phone is trumped-up to be ""surgical grade steel"" and ""the hardest glass ever on a phone."" Watch the drop-tests to see how easily the glass breaks and see how slippery the ""surgical grade steel"" is to hold onto. You will definitely want a case for your handset. Break the back of your phone? Apple will charge you over $500 to repair it!
While the processors and memory run quite efficiently with IOS (the best feature of an iPhone), IOS itself has become buggier with each iteration. Autocorrect has gone bonkers with IOS 11, autocorrecting words for no apparent reason or changing letters on you.
It's great that Apple has ""gotten with the times"" and offers fast charging and wireless charging. Unfortunately, the charger included in the box isn't a fast charger - there is a separate charge for that. Same goes for the Wireless charging.
Apple is really pushing AR (augmented reality) as if they invented it. AR has been around for years and is much simpler than VR (virtual reality). You've probably been using AR for years without even realizing that is what it was. Such as apps like Messenger or Snapchat putting hats on your head or making you puke a rainbow. Or hunting Pokémon where you see the Pokémon in the real world through your camera's viewfinder. Yep, that's AR and it's been around. When Apple lets you strap a VR headset to your face and explore get back to me.
All in all, the phone is a nice next step from Apple and they are finally getting with the times. But it's not the greatest phone ever made nor the greatest iPhone ever made.",3
att.com,iphone,"This phone is amazing! I was a bit skeptical getting it because it didn't have the Home button. I thought it would take a couple weeks getting use to the phone, but after the 2nd day I'm good. It is a natural function using the swipe for changing apps and navigating the UI. The battery life so far is lasting more than a day with continuous use. Switching from the iPhone 7 Plus to the X was the easist switch ever. Within half an hour I was up and running. It was worth the wait.",5
att.com,iphone,I’ve had every iPhone since 2007 and this iPhone is by far the most overpriced overrated iPhone ever. I used the phone for only an hour before boxing it back up to return. I’ll wait for Apple to come out with a new plus sized iPhone X. Until then I got a Note 8.,1
att.com,iphone,"I was using the 6plus for the last three years. This was a leap for the money. Have to say I like the slightly smaller size even though the screen is about the same height but a bit narrower than the plus. The two biggest improvements, besides the speed which is very fast, is Face ID. Super fast even in low light and great that it works in most of my locked apps. Other great feature is no home button. Just a flick up from the bottom opens home from any app and swipe down from upper right to access camera and calculator screen.",5
att.com,iphone,"it’s different. 7plus has been, by far, my favorite iPhone incarnation. I was given X for my birthday and I feel like I went back to a 4 because of its size. Since we have been with iPhone since it’s inception, I feel somewhat obligated to give the X a chance. I’m really missing my 7 plus though so I don’t know if I’ll give X to my son or not",4
att.com,iphone,"I absolute love everything about this phone. I was so hesitant to get it I also settled for the 8, but I am big on photo quality and this phone beats all my expectations. Well worth the price by all means. The only thing I dislike is that since it's all glass it feels very slippery and fragile to the touch, but it's nothing a good case can't fix.",5
att.com,iphone,"I was skeptical of the iPhone X at first because of it’s cost and the fact that it was all glass. After reading reviews online, I decided to try the phone out and return it if I didn’t like it without risk thanks to AT&T’s good return policy for online purchases. I’ve had the phone now for a little over a week now and I absolutely love it. It’s so easy to use and moves so smoothly. The screen is amazing. The phone looks amazing and still feels sturdy even though it is made of glass! I will be keeping this phone. I love it!",5
att.com,iphone,"It's Terrible. Everyone that I speak to (on the phone) says that it sounds as if I am underwater before the crackling begins and I have to hang up . Now, I have to return the phone within the 2 week window of purchase which is a real inconvenience for me as I have a broken leg that I can't bear any weight on.",1
att.com,iphone,Absolutely love this iPhone! So glad it’s a full screen iPhone! I was thinking about switching back to the galaxy before I heard rumors of the iPhone X and I’m so glad I held off and waited! It was so easy to get use to the new gestures. Within a day it become natural! I still at times reach for the home button since I was so use to it though. I would definitely recommend this phone! I do wish the battery life was a little better though. I came from the 7 plus and actually prefer the size of the x better than the plus!,5
att.com,iphone,I like the iPhone X because it provides a slightly larger screen without being as big as some of the other models (i.e. it still fits in my clutch). It took a minute to get used to the phone not having the home button or ear phone port. It does come with the dongle but we went ahead and purchased the blue tooth ear pods.,5
att.com,iphone,"I love my iphone 10! I actually prefer the size of the 10, not too big nor too small! The camera is absolutely phenomenal!!! Facial recognition work quickly and recognizes me with my glasses on! I know it’s pricey but so worth it! Oh and the battery life is great as well! Overall I’m pleased with Apple this time around!",5
att.com,iphone,"After two days my phone stopped being touch sensitive and recognizing my face. I restarted it mutiple times and had to spend three hours at a store to get it fixed!! It was brand new and had no reason to stop functioning. Overall, I should have just kept my old phone.",1
att.com,iphone,"Not happy at all with this phone. First iPhone I’m not pleased with. It freezes and it has kinks in it when scrolling through photos sent through messages, for example. It’s more like an Android freezing up than a smooth iPhone. I regret getting it and wish I had gone 8 plus. I’ve had this phone for four months. :-(",1
att.com,iphone,I got my wife her I-Phone X and she loves it. I was not as sold on the phone as the access changes to the phone (without the button) seemed a little odd. Man oh man was I wrong. Apple made this phone with easability in mind. Accessing my screen is so much easier and more efficient. The camera is TRULY AMAZING! And the Space Gray color is really cutting edge in design. I am a very very satisfied customer and equally satisfied with this phone. I havent even began to know all this phone can do. You WILL be satisfied.,5
att.com,iphone,"I have only owned it since Saturday and haven’t used all the functions yet but what I have used is impressive. Speakers sound better than my iPhone 6 , face recognition is neat, a little heavier than my 6. I have owned iPhones since the 3 and they keep getting better. Not sure that they should be called phones anymore but really - the phone accounts for a minor part of functionality. Apple should have a contest to rename the iphone.",4
att.com,iphone,"Received the ten on launch day, it took a couple days to get use to but overall I was satisfied. It wasn't until I had to use my 7 Plus again to reset it that I really noticed a difference; the 7 Plus seemed old. The gestures of the ten really make the 7 Plus seemed as if it came out 3-4 years ago and not one.
The battery is better than I thought and what many have told me, the phone is a little thicker and heavier than my previous but you get use to it quickly.
Overall I'm very happy and would recommend.",5
att.com,iphone,"I have been an Iphone user for 5 years or so. The X is my third Iphone. I love the size of it and my 4 year old LOVES the animated emoji thing. The camera is really good, but doesn't feel much different than the camera on the 8. What is very different is not having a home button. One of the biggest reasons I miss it is that you HAVE to pick up your phone to access the home page. You can't just put your finger on the home button to be recognized. You have to pick it up so your facial recognition will work. One other thing that I don't think any of the engineers thought about - SWIPING UP FOR EVERYTHING CAN CAUSE FOREARM FATIGUE! Think about it, pressing a button with your thumb is a lot easier than moving your hole thumb 1 to 2 inches up 1000 times throughout the day. I have had the phone for 2 weeks or so, but I have noticed that on days I've used the phone a lot that my right forearm is tired.
All in all it's a cool phone. But I wish they had left the home button alone.",3
att.com,iphone,"I had a Samsung S8 before I got a IPhone because everyone say it was better. Big lie!!! Small screen, no finger print, gps sucks, notifications are annoying you need to go one by one to delete them instead of just slide them I can’t download a lot of apps the system of Apple make the use of the phone slow. I miss the finger print. Many of my old videos I transfer over I can’t watch them because they aren’t iPhone videos. Many of the apps that I like to use before free of charge I’m froze to start paying",2
att.com,iphone,"I should have know better. Been buying iPhones since day one. They have been real misses the past few years. I thought I’d give it one last go. Nope! The screen is full size. Aside from that...same old phone. Don’t waste your money. This thing is waaaaaaaay to expensive for you to be disappointed.
The customer service at AT&T was outstanding however. That is something I really appreciated.
While filling out the survey here it only lists online, store and other. I chose other because I called them and ordered the phone. I say this so you know my issues with the phone aren’t because I bought some knock off from a guy on the internet when you see “other”.
Good luck. Consider an 8 or maybe even a 7. Spend the rest of the money on something better! Hope this helps.",2
att.com,iphone,I used to have the S8+ the screen is bigger and the phone is lighter. The iPhone X is heavy compared to other iPhones. I do like the Face ID. I’m not blown away by this phone and the camera is still not as good as android. I don’t hate the phone but don’t love it either.,3
att.com,iphone,It has been almost a week since upgrading from the 6S to the X. I’m pleased with the battery life compared to the 6S and obviously the numerous other upgrades that come with the phone. It takes some getting used to going from having the touch button to face recognition.,5
att.com,iphone,I went from Samsung to the new iPhone 8 and loved it enough that when my oldest wanted an I phone 8 I up graded to the IPhone X. It take a little bit to get use to no home button and the battery doesn’t seem to stay charged as long as the 8 but overall it’s a great phone,4
att.com,iphone,An easy switch from the iPhone style before. Gestures and face scan are very quick and easy to learn. Have noticed a few glitches with the software. Bottom bar where the four apps are don’t load sometimes and time on the lock screen disappears and I have to restart phone to get it back. That and random other glitches which are expected with a first iteration of a phone aren’t deal breakers. All in all a good phone with a great camera.,4
att.com,iphone,"The phone itself is amazing the problem is the battery. I have to have the brightness almost all the way down and can’t really mess with it very much in order for it to last the whole day. It’s a powerhouse phone though, just be prepared to be chained to a wall outlet.",3
att.com,iphone,"Simply put.... Amazing !!! When the phone first came out I thought it was just a gadget and not worth the money. However after a week of using it, I can honestly say I was wrong. Love the full screen display, facial recognition and other new features. Great phone !!!",5
att.com,iphone,"superfast operating system. attractive phone. physically smaller than my previous 6 plus and yet the screen size remains very close to the same, so fits in pockets better. good job Apple. AT&T offers made this a sweet buy one get one. sweet deal. everyone wins!",5
att.com,iphone,I have the hands of a child so it’s nice to have the screen size but ability to hold it. It takes some getting used to but it’s worth it. The only negative is having to pick your phone up for Face ID. Aside from that the phone is beautiful and amazing photos!,5
att.com,iphone,Pros: Liked the X very much . The look and feel is rich when compared to other iPhones. OS gestures are nice and cool. Cameras are superb. Cons: FaceID is not appropriate when too close and some angles. felt few gms heavy then my old iphone. Expensive.,5
att.com,iphone,I’m a big customer of ATT and after 5 days of stress with a defective screen I was told to go to apple. Apple said I should go to ATT. Att is supposedly exchange a bad phone after a few days and would not do it. Or offer a full refund. I wasted days.,1
att.com,iphone,"Calling the iPhone X a “phone” is like calling an automobile a seat. You can sit in a car, but that understates it’s full potential. The iPhone X can make phone calls, but that’s only a feature.
The iPhone X provides worldwide access to the 54 integrated services offered by Apple. Anything that I can do with my iMac, MacBook, and iPad, I can do with my iPhone X, but only the iPhone X allows me to do it outdoors in the rain.",5
att.com,iphone,The new I phone X is fun to use. I had to online a couple times to figure out what I had to do. I consider this a learning curve. If you’re willing to learn new things then you’re never to old for an I phone X. I’m 66 years old and still learning.,5
att.com,iphone,"I’ve had mine for about a week now, and it’s been great! Easy to manipulate and navigate through different apps. It took some getting used to, with there being no home button. The only issue I have is how hot it gets sometimes while being used.",5
att.com,iphone,"I was hesitant to go with the new iPhone X because of the facial recognition and going away from the home button and finger print verification. I have to say I am SO amazingly pleased and wish I had switched along time ago. I LOVE it!! It literally is all of the best things from the iPhone and best features from the android together. I have become the newest spokesperson for the X, taking to all my friends and family about how great it is and how easy it is to use. I wouldn't go back for anything.",5
att.com,iphone,I have had every iPhone there is and this one is not my favorite. I find myself missing my 7 plus. Mainly due to the size of the X. If I could do it again I would either keep my 7 or go with the 8 plus. Although this truly is a great phone.,4
att.com,iphone,"I just got mine last night, so I haven't had much time to play with it, but right off the bat, I am disappointed with the size of the phone, coming off of a Plus.",4
att.com,iphone,Freezing and slow. Just right now I’m trying to write this review and the screen touch doesn’t work. It’s horrible waisting time in this phone searching something on safari or open application or trying to correct any text,1
att.com,iphone,"The iPhone X is getting a bad rap from some folks. I’ve had it for a few weeks now and love it. The facial recognition is excellent. It even worked with ski goggles on. The notch everyone complains about is barely noticeable after the first 2 minutes of use. The camera is awesome and has cool features (4K video). Also, the swiping motions are far more natural than the home button. It’s sad more people aren’t buying this phone and that Apple is rumored to be discontinuing it this summer.",5
att.com,iphone,"I bought the X after having a 6 Plus and have been very happy with it. The size is better, it looks better with glass on the front and the back and the functionality is easy to grasp. One of the aspects I like is the removal of the home button. It used to get fingerprints on it and wouldn’t work so I had to use the passcode which was a pain. Now, I just hold the phone up and it works due to facial recognition. If you are willing to pay the hefty price tag, I highly recommend the iPhone X.",5
att.com,iphone,This phone is one of the better phones to have if your a smart person. People say it takes extra steps but they really just made it more simpler for the newer generations which are the ones who are getting phones earlier and have rich parents who can afford phones like this. This phone has met all expectations besides the price I wish it was cheaper but for the deal I had 1000$ for 2 iPhones X not a bad deal at all.,5
att.com,iphone,"Everything takes extra steps to do. Closing programs takes 3 steps now, logging in takes 2. I have had my iPhone X for about a month and I’d love to have my iPhone 6 back. With a few tweaks, this could be an awesome phone.",2
att.com,iphone,I have had and iPhone S5 for sometime but it was just not working well anymore. I have already done more with the iPhone X than I ever could do with the 5S. Great Text capable and voice works good on calls,5
att.com,iphone,"Moving from an iPhone 4 ( not upgraded for 244 weeks) to an iPhone X , the new phone seems like magic. Old phone still ran just as fast but the features on the new phone are like wizardry! Awesome!!!!!!!!",5

att.com,iphone,All I hear about is the notch protruding on the iPhone X ..... I haven’t even noticed it... I was going to get the iPhone 8 Plus because of the negative reviews... I am so glad I got the iPhone X!!!!!,5

att.com,iphone,"Don’t waste your hard-earned grand-plus dollars. Even if you finance it. I’m already reading that sales on iPhoneX have been so low, that they probably will discontinue this model. LOL !",1
att.com,iphone,"I never intended to get an iPhone X cause I already had a 7. Yet since I was switching to AT&T I decided to go all in and gotta say don’t regret the decision. The X is pretty amazing. The initial adjustment to facial recognition from finger biometrics was pretty quick. Also, I’m surprised at how much more responsive Siri is. I never really used it that often in the past cause well Siri was garbage. I enjoyed the couple weeks I had the X now and hope to enjoy it for the next few years.",5
att.com,iphone,"I like the quality of the phone. It’s clearly better than any other iPhone. I like the bigger screen. The only thing I don’t like is that you have to have to have your face in front of phone to unlock it, which you did not have to do when there was a fingerprint. I also don’t like that you can’t just swipe the windows to close them anymore which is easier than the way you have to do it now. You have to hold it and hit the x on top to close each one. Takes more time. And it’s annoying",4
att.com,iphone,"I like the speed a lot. My old iPhone was really getting slow. I wasn’t sure about face recognition at first, but I’ve warmed up to it. I wish I could store more than one version of myself, because I had to choose between wearing glasses or not wearing them, but that’s not the end of the world. The photo features are pretty cool, too. There’s a bit of a learning curve, just like with any new device, but it does everything that’s important to me, and has a few extra features to boot.",5
att.com,iphone,I love it The best phone ever The Face ID change the concept of password This is a phone without a password But that facility is only for the owner of the phone Terrific,5
att.com,iphone,I’ve had an iPhone on and off since 2010. I’ve been the girl who would go back and forth through Samsung and iPhone. And overall I’m sticking with iPhone. I just switch from the note 8 and even though I lived the note 8 I had to go back to apple and get the X ive had this phone for a week and I am very impressed with the phone. The Face ID works great even in very low light. It’s worked about 98% of the time which was about the same for me as Touch ID. Of course when it does work just put in the passcode. The phone fits great in my hand. I like how it’s small like the 8 but the screen is BIGGER than the 8 plus even if it doesn’t seem like it. The cameras are amazing as usual and the Animoji feature is so much fun. I did have a slight problem after the 3 day. The screen went black and took 10 mins to turn back on. I was about to return but I realized it needed an update and it’s been working fin ever since. I do think the price of the phone needs to be lower and it was hyped up a little too much but over all I love it. Ppl wanted a change from apple and now they got it. Just keep in mind that no phone is perfect.,5
att.com,iphone,I like the size and design so far still learning all the features but wish I could of had more time to learn how to use it before having to write a review of this product,4
att.com,iphone,The cameras take great pictures and I thought the size would be bother me but it’s so much easier to text on than my IPhone 7 Plus. I love how the silver looks .,5
att.com,iphone,It’s an ok phone but the screen durability is cheap not very sturdy I only had it a few weeks it’s been in my pocket and has scratches all across the screen,3
att.com,iphone,"I love the phone! It took me a little while to get accustomed to not having the home button (for sign in on bank app, etc.). Easy functionality, great pics!",5
att.com,iphone,I was Nervous to get the new iPhone X but I decided To treat myself! It’s as awesome as I had Hoped! The camera is amazing and the screen is beautiful!!!,5

att.com,iphone,"I use to bean android guy, and first tasteof iPhone in when the 6s came out loved it. But this iPhone x is like the same thing no different features nothing up apart from facial recognition and the home button is gone. Its not worth the money, too expensive. Thought for sure there would be alot more to it. Not to mention the front camera is no better than it has been already poor apple!!!",2

att.com,iphone,"Just came off a Moto Z Android 3 years did the job. Happy be back Apple as very convenient having two Mac Book pros, 4 i Pads, two I Pone X's. ATT was terrific when got to company store 3 vendor stores wouldn't give me time of day beaus I bought the phones from ATT over the phone after being impressed with ATT installation and performance of fiber WiFi and TV and professionalism of technician, quality of work.... WiFi ordered 100 M bits upload getting 123-126.",5
att.com,iphone,Battery is absolutely horrible! They take away more and more each time no fingerprint scanner and hardware is glitchy and quite slow not impressed,1
att.com,iphone,"I was like most people when the design was first released. I was worried about the notch being bothersome or obstructing your view on the screen. It seems that it’s hardly noticaeble. I also figured it would take time to get used to not having a home button. That seems to not be the case either. I’m really impressed with how it felt natural without it. This iPhone is absolutely gorgeous. The price may be expensive, maybe even too expensive, but I feel that the phone is built very very well. Only issue, being the glass back, but so far I’ve had a couple of drops, thankfully no shatters with a Speck case from Wal-Mart.
The battery sort of dissappoints me sometimes.. Some days, however, I’m very impressed with the battery. It typically depends on my usage. It gets me through the day, more so than my iPhone 7 Plus did.
Speaking of which, I’d picked up my 7 Plus the other day after using this phone for over a week now and it feels like a brick. Lol I like the smaller design, the screen is slightly bigger than the plus and edge to edge display, I really love this phone so far. I would recommend getting one if it is within your budget.",4
att.com,iphone,The iPhone X is a superb device. A definitive improvement from my previous iPhone 7 Plus. I wanted to own the 10th Anniversary Edition iPhone.,5
att.com,iphone,"I like the phone but it has its problems. My 6 plus actually had better reception. Upgrading to xs max, hopefully works better than this one.",3
att.com,iphone,Speed and camera are great. But when making phone calls people tell me my voice sounds weak. Didn't have this problem with my I Phone 4.,4
att.com,iphone,"Pros: great design, superb OLED display and speed. Cons: learning curve with new gestures, battery life is good not better than +",4
att.com,iphone,It’s a pretty phone but way overpriced especially considering you don’t get anything nice like AirPods or a quick charging cable. I had the s8 and it cost much less and came with a quick charging cable and good headphones (apples suck). Save yourself money and get more and get a galaxy s8.,1
att.com,iphone,"Nice looking phone, but that’s about it. Good luck trying to get WiFi to work correctly. I completely regret this purchase",1
att.com,iphone,Better than my six but sad that I’m having a problem finding what I call a really safe cover. Which really isn’t at&t’s Issue.,4
att.com,iphone,"Face recognition works well, great new bells and whistles, good camera. I would not have upgraded if I had not broken my 7...",5
att.com,iphone,"I hate to say it, but coming from a plus phone this is not my ideal size. I like the phone, but definitely wish it were larger. I think it was a bad choice for  not to make the phone available in a larger phone. I realize there is a larger viewing screen but I prefer the larger phone. If I had to do it all over again I would have probably just gotten the 8 Plus. I did have that option but at the time I figured the size wouldn’t be a problem but I sure do miss my 6S Plus.",3
att.com,iphone,"I do not like that the finger scan is no longer an option. The facial scan is not always working. The previous iPhone would allow you to touch the screen while watching something to give you the time, this has been removed. The X should be more convenient to access, use and be updated however this is not the case. Disappointed that I purchased such an expensive phone and not have the updated technology. Additionally the iPhone (1) watch does not work well with the X.",2
att.com,iphone,For those who already have iPhone X - there is absolutely no reason to switch to Xs- unless you must have gold phone,5
att.com,iphone,"Face recognition works perfectly! You get used to new gestures in no time! A little overpriced, but great phone.",5
att.com,iphone,"I am getting use to the X. I like the facial recognition feature works great. The only thing I actually was shocked with was the size. Even though it has a bigger screen, most apps don’t use the whole screen and I thought the phone would have been bigger. I had an iPhone 7plus and I actually liked the size and feel of it. Just wish the X was bigger. I also would love to be an Apple product tester, I would love to test and give feedback and ideas on Apple products.",4
att.com,iphone,I’ve been using iPhones since the 3GS and this X is by far the best apple has put out.. I love the Face ID.,5
att.com,iphone,"This is my 3rd iPhone this is the best one ever. Love the camera/video. The apps are great, a great phone",5
att.com,iphone,I️ love it ! I️ bought the first iPhone and up graded every other year after that. This one is the best.,5
att.com,iphone,Facial recognition Is such a time saver! I love 256 version because I have room for everything.,5
att.com,iphone,The phone isn’t much different than the previous versions and the price tag isn’t worth it.,3
att.com,iphone,The IphoneX is imagination at work.Dreamers with an ideal a concept and a design team..,5
att.com,iphone,"I was excited for my new iphone and i was greatly disappointed out of the box literally when i found my phone to have a small dent on the top left screen. Im not sure if this is a new feature on the iPhone X but i can assume it is not. The expectation of a new phone is that it is in pristine quality. Now if i want to replace it i have to pay additional costs, my previous phone of three years had not damage on the screen and right out of the box I've got some damage.",1
att.com,iphone,The key characteristic of iPhone X is SPEED. Now I do everything so fast as I think.,5
att.com,iphone,Love the Face ID. This design takes a little time to get used but I’m loving it.,5
att.com,iphone,The iPhone X is not worth the money. It slow and gets stuck on screens.,1
att.com,iphone,"I'd read a few negative reviews, but I think they were paid to write them. This phone is nothing short of amazing. I'd been using the + size prior to this, and while the case is smaller, the screen size is actually slightly bigger (length). The new gestures were easy to pick up quickly, and face recognition is nothing short of amazing, even in low light. I was a bit leery of buying this phone initially, but no regrets at all. The camera is fantastic as well.",5
att.com,iphone,Very easily scratched. Good idea to get a screen protector and case.,3
att.com,iphone,I love the new phone. Not too big but a little heavier which I love,5
att.com,iphone,"I do not write reviews often but I do read them. I have been an iPhone user since the iPhone 5 came about. This phone is absolutely incredible. The photos, the ease of swapping from one phone to the next... ease of navigation and battery life... I could go on and on. I am imprsssed and so glad I didn’t slip up and decide to try the android OS. I have nothing against it but I was doubtful that Apple could step up, again. Well.. they did and I couldn’t be happier!",5
att.com,iphone,I have owned all of the iPhones. The 10 is my favorite.,5
att.com,iphone,Exceeded expectations with performance and visibility,4
att.com,iphone,The performance of this iPhone is unbelievable!!,5
att.com,iphone,I had a really bad experience with my iPhone X,1
att.com,iphone,"Coming from iPhone 6S to X, this is a major improvement in terms of picture and interface. The picture is so clear and sharp. I cant even look at my 6S anymore. The new face ID is awesome. At first it feels weird not to have a home button, but I got used to it after a day and now I feel like the home button is archaic.
I got the 256 GB version and thats worth the value (not much difference from 64 GB).
Only con is I wish for a larger plus screen size.",5
att.com,iphone,Way too many glitches ! So disappointed,1
att.com,iphone,Don’t like it too much swiping to open phone,1
att.com,iphone,"I upgraded from iPhone 7Plus and I am regretting it. The X is very small compared to 7Plus and holding the X simply is undesirable. The keyboard has entirely too much wasted space and still without multitask keys. FaceID works without any issue and is quick! However, the bottom line is...it’s still just an iPhone",2
att.com,iphone,I think way to much money for just o phone,3
att.com,iphone,"I have to say I myself am very impressed with the iPhone. For those coming from anything “plus” yes it will initially feel smaller. But you will quickly find that you fall in love with the speed and easy use of the phone so that you stop noticing the size difference. The screen is the most crisp it has ever been, with a beautiful display. If all else falls just open the camera... apple has truly outdone itself with the best camera to ever hit a apple device.",5
att.com,iphone,Way to much money for hype that just isn't there returning for a cheaper same quality phone.,3
att.com,iphone,"Amazing phone! It has a lot of android similarities except it is on the Apple/Mac platform. My reasons to purchase the iPhone X was, I wanted a large screen without a large phone. With the edge-to-edge screen, you get the iPhone 6/7/8 overall size with the screen of an iPhone 8 Plus. the picture/screen quality is amazing and the battery last all day with moderate video watching. As expected, all my important data is available on my phone, MacBook, and iPad through my Apple ID and I can text and talk through all 3 devices when connected to the same WiFi. I also enjoy the ease of FaceTime with my young son when I am on travel or overseas. While there are other mediums to video chat, none can compare to the audio and video quality of FaceTime. I am completely satisfied with the iPhone X and well stay with Apple for years to come.",5
att.com,iphone,"Bought the phone against reviews. Wondered if I'd adjust to no home button at the bottom. I use voiceover almost daily when I walk to listen to my Kindle books. Had to go back and have them help me -- but it works even better than my other iPhone. I try to stay knowledgeable concerning electronics or else life will pass me by. I am finding I have adjusted to the iPhone 10. It is an easy size to hold and use with one hand. I think it looks ""classy"".",5
att.com,iphone,"The swipe down from upper right of the screen is the main change i don't appreciate. The volume in maximum mode is WAY too loud. I have anxiety and jump when my phone goes off if its at max volume. The change from ""Wednesday"" to ""Wed"" on the calendar app icon is not necessary. And why isn't there an AM or PM for the time while I'm in the phone? The absence of a headphone jack is depressing.",2
att.com,iphone,I didn't like the iPhone X I'm glad I returned it it was disappointing all the way around I went back to my plus size iPhone 8 plus I love it way better only thing was good about the iPhone X was the speed and camera all the hype is gone about the iPhone X as a iPhone user if you love the plus size stick it with it iPhone X will not be for you.,2
att.com,iphone,This is a major overhaul from previous models. It’s fast! You get more screen from a smaller handset. The gestures became second nature to me within 2 days. Everything is so fluid in terms of switching apps or tasks. There are new things to learn in terms of how to take screenshots or do a hard reset. Accessing the control center is easy from the top right hand corner. The notch in the screen doesn’t bother me a bit. I do not miss the bulk of my 6+. I’m a woman with smaller hands and it’s still easy to operate the phone with one hand. I understand there is an iPhone XL coming but I am over carrying around a bulky phone. Also the phone is a beautiful piece of eye candy but did I mention it’s fast!!! Also the addition of wireless charging is a huge bonus. I am thoroughly happy with my IPX & find that I can’t put it down.,5
att.com,iphone,I’m not by any means an Apple cult member. I own all PC computers and I detest iTunes witj a passion. I got the iPhone X Because I was due for an upgrade from my 6+. So just to let you know this thing is great. Slightly smaller size I thought I wouldn’t like but it really fits in the hand much better and all the new gestures make this thing great for a single thumb use. And the battery life is amazing. Go ahead spend a lil extra you’ll be glad you did.,5
att.com,iphone,"This phone is awesome!!! I love the slimness . I can reach across it with one hand. I love the glass & chrome, very unique . And I don’t miss the back button at all . I have a clear case so I can see the phone . And the Animoji’s we have laughed till we cried lol plus I’m still learning lots of fun & interesting things about it everyday.",5
att.com,iphone,The phone shutz down by itself. It doesn't send out message. Juz horrible phone.,2
att.com,iphone,"This is a really good phone for anyone, however the battery is not that great. It's going to be challenging the week, while you get used to learning how to maneuver around the phone without a button. I would say look at youtu hmmm e reviews and videos before you buy the phone as well. The phone has froze a couple times and it takes a few minutes to unfreeze because there is no button. I haven't figured out how to restart it without the button yet.",5
att.com,iphone,Well overall the phone itself is wonderful. They are pros and cons to all new technology. I like the phone is heavier so it seems more sturdy and the clarity of the pictures and videos due to the camera upgrades are great. One of the few cons I see is that the entire phone is made of glass which makes me very nervous about dropping it. Don’t believe the hype of the video on the web or you can just take it and throw it. I would advise against that.,4
att.com,iphone,"This phone seems to work good, just needs to be more durable and the battery percentage back. Price is too high and apple didn’t add a lot of features for the price. I feel like a lot more people would use apple if it was more customizable and could add personal stuff and music and ringtones without having to use iTunes. Also it seems like iTunes has fewer options and harder to navigate every time it has an update. Overall, it seems to be alright.",4
att.com,iphone,"The iPhone X is lighting fast with the A-11 processor. Computing now is becoming an ""extension"" of you, the user rather than a device to be clumsy with. The face recognition is flawless, and remains flawless among your apps---even in the dark. The iPhone X is heavy to the feel, representing the integrity of the build and materials utilized. The AR (augmented reality) chips combined with Haptic (touch, feel, movement et al) make experiential things fun and productive----AR apps are specifically available. I had the 5, and two 6S and they were fine------the X takes a device to a new level of human/ machine interface. The wireless charging works through ""inductive"" technology. It works better than I imagined due to the physical design of the battery, and works well through my Tech 21 clear case. Apple's OWN charging solution will be nice as to support 3 devices charging at once. 7.5 Watts is the power coming from a Belkin Boost wireless charger. Some chargers boast 15 watts but the iPhone is set by Apple to utilize only 7.5 watts. I believe that they do this because the battery could get warm, and then limit itself by design to 80% charge capacity until in a cooler environment. I would recommend utilizing the manufacturer's recommended wireless charging solution---is simple, as is almost everything about this phone.",5
att.com,iphone,"I am thoroughly enjoying getting to know my new phone. Once again, Apple has created a fun to use phone that still gives me a little challenge as I navigate the improvements. The face recognition is so cool and much more accurate than the fingerprint recognition ever was. The slight increase in size over the 7 is just right. I was not planning on a new phone, but with some slight issues with my 7, I am glad I made the change. The X is incredible!",5
att.com,iphone,"What can I say.....it is a really nice device. Does it live up to the hype, I am not sure just yet. With all of the tech, it will be a device of the future. I have not had any issues with the face ID as has been reported on a few reviews. However, need more apps to be updated to take advantage of everything the phone can do.",4
att.com,iphone,"I have just gone from an iPhone 4s to the iPhone X. It is like learning all over again what a iPhone can do. With the help of my granddaughters (10 & 12) I now feel pretty comfortable with the new iPhone X. However, there's still a number of things I need to learn before I consider myself confident to explain them to others.",5
att.com,iphone,This phone is absolutely amazing. I bought it for the camera. I take pictures all the time and the pictures are fantastic. I come from an iPhone 6s Plus and I think the iPhone X size is perfect. The screen is extremely clear. Btw I’m not over exaggerating. This is a great phone! I think people just want to complain to complain.,5
att.com,iphone,"I bought this phone for my son two weeks ago. We have to return it already because he keeps getting green lines across his screen. We called Apple help and they stayed on the phone for over an hour and then told him he needed to talk it in to get it replaced. However, there were no appts avail at the locations for weeks.",2
att.com,iphone,"The iPhone X is simply a very overpriced piece of hardware. I jump between Android and iOS often, it seems Samsung, OnePlus, Google, Huawei, even LG are catching up or in some cases pulling ahead of Apple's innovation. Apple has done a tremendous job building their brand to the extent if you would place the Apple logo on some of the devices built by the manufacturers listed above people would lose their minds. Now back to the iPhone X, it is basically an iPhone 7 Plus with the exception of a smaller body, infinity screen, wireless charging, and facial recognition. Let's face it, Apple is late to the game with most of those features. Unfortunately, I am stuck paying $33.34/month for an underwhelming device with an iPhone 7 Plus-like performance. This is just my opinion and it comes down to the price of the hardware and what is available on the market at a lower price point. If Apple bumped the price down $150-$200 I would probably increase my rating to 4, not 3 stars.",3
att.com,iphone,Hate the size!!!! Way to small compared to the iPhone 7 Plus.,1
att.com,iphone,"I am more than pleased with my new X! I previously had the 7 plus which I loved BUT the X is the perfect size to manage with one hand again which is the one thing I missed going to the plus. No home button, no problem, it was a quick and easy adjustment. I only miss the percentage option for battery indicator. OVERALL SOLID DEVICE! I’ve had every phone since 3g iPhone!",5
att.com,iphone,"The iPhone X is a very high tech phone. It has been quite the adjustment getting used to the home button not being there. There’s a few changes from the old iPhone features that I’m not a fan of. Such as, the battery percentage not displaying unless you pull down the control panel. I also feel like the system runs dramatically slower than the previous iPhones I’ve had over the years. But overall, I am impressed with all of the positives.",4
att.com,iphone,"The phone is fine, but it needs the touch button also it’s sort of tricky to use. Before I’d just tap the button now I have to keep tapping the screen till it lites up. Now every time I log into an app. I have to use the passcode, before the print was one and done. I should of just kept the iPhone 6 ........,",3
att.com,iphone,"The phone has been amazing, another triumph for Apple. There is a learning curve on this phone as the home button has been replaced with gestures and swipes on the screen. I am technologically oriented so I picked all this up quickly, for many there will be a learning curve from the traditional iPhone. The screen is amazingly crisp, clear and precise. Photos are great with both the telephoto and portrait cameras being image stabilized.",5
att.com,iphone,"I traded in my iPhone 7 Plus for the iPhone X over two weeks ago and I have been satisfied completely, if not more. I was worried about the physical size of the phone, but, compared to my iPhone 7 Plus I was trading in, the screen size of the iPhone X is exactly the same as the iPhone 7 Plus. Within hours, I adjusted quickly to not having a home button. The speed of the phone is great, along with the cameras. The pictures are amazing.",5
att.com,iphone,"After my 7 plus red went for a swim in 4th of July I ended up having to go back to an android which was awful! I went last week and purchased an X, and absolutely love it! I love the features as well as the size of the phone. The screen itself is the same size as a plus, just on a smaller phone since the screen is the entire phone. Apple has hit it out of the park again! Can’t wait to see what they come out with next! Thank you Apple!",5
att.com,iphone,"The iPhone X is a great phone. The sleek design and the full screen is incomparable to all other iPhones. The only thing con is the face recognition . It’s not as easy as putting your finger to unlock . You have to look at the screen or be facing toward it . So for those of us who like to unlock our phone while our face is buried in a pillow, it makes us get up and face the screen. Other than that I love this phone and glad I got it",5
att.com,iphone,"I wish I had not traded my IPhone 6s+:( no home button, transfer of contacts didn’t work completely, my sister and bro-in-law got IPhone 8, much happier. Plus I read today Apple will discontinue the IPhone X next year..I am like what? After I obligate myself to AT&T for two years!!!! Not happy at all.",2
att.com,iphone,I preordered my iPhone X and it arrived earlier then quoted. It is the best phone I’ve ever owned. Everything is so smooth and fluent. No issues whatsoever. OLED display is amazing. Wireless charging is superb. My iPhone charges to 50% in 25min. I don’t have to charge it overnight anymore and no more cables. I even bought a dust plug for lightning port since I don’t intend of using it. Lol. Face ID is amazingly fast and accurate. Tried it on my whole family and it only unlocks on me. The key is to do a face scan in a well lit room and hold the phone at the level you usually use to view it on. The size is perfect. Fits my pants front pocket better then iPhone 7 Plus. Cameras are great. New Animojis are fun. I highly recommend iPhone X. If you are on Next plan the difference between iPhone 7 Plus 256gb and new iPhone X is only $1.69 a month. Well worth it.,5
att.com,iphone,I've had iPhones since the first generation and this is by far the best one yet. The display is very clear and bright and it's the perfect size for me. It did take me a while to adjust to the new controls. Having the facial recognition instead of the fingerprint reader on the home button was a change. Now that I'm used to it I really like it. The facial recognition on apps is super convenient. Battery life is also very good.,5
att.com,iphone,"The iPhone X is a beautiful peace of technology. Its smaller than the 7s, this make it easy to put in your pocket. The face ID works very well. The 4K movies are astonishing! I disable the Tap to Wake and Raise to wake, I hate them. I do not like the notch, Apple can you do something about it?",5
att.com,iphone,"It’s cool, I don’t know why they would Discontinue the phone because it is extremely accessible the only thing that I really don’t care for it is it seems as if my battery dies fairly quickly rather than that it was well worth the purchase if you are up on technology I would say go ahead and get the X but if you are one of the people that live in the Stone Age or under a rock. do not get the iPhone X and expected to cure cancer",5
att.com,iphone,"Face recognition is not secure. Phone apps constantly shut down unexpectedly while using. Phone freezes often. Although a benefit is supposed to be to have a more compact phone with a big screen, everything appears smaller...it is an adjustment after having Plus iPhones for a while.",1
att.com,iphone,I upgraded from a 5s. This phone was worth the wait and learning more features on it every day. It’s a 10plus for sure!,5
att.com,iphone,"I was a bit skeptical to order the “X” being that my 6 was starting to act up. But needless to say all my worries are behind me, truly an amazing phone with so many possibilities. The camera is the highlight of the phone though. Crystal clear images, astonishing quality, the features and edit capabilities are the icing on the cake. I am happy with the purchase and would like to thank apple for there genius and ingenuity.",5
att.com,iphone,I did not like the IPhone X at all. It is not user friendly to me. I was just not comfortable with the size overall. The screen was great but I was disappointed. I shipped it back to get a different cell phone!,1
att.com,iphone,"What I love: - The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black). - The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it. - The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my pockets. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 7. The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one, check one out at a local store. - I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 7 was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth. - Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way. - The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera. - The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening. - The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it.",5
att.com,iphone,Face detection vs finger print reader isn’t even close. It feels like the product was rushed to bring to market without a home button. Lots of things are good about the phone but LOTS of bad. Screen is great however the gestures could be a lot better. The phone feels like it questions what you want it to do. Flipping between apps takes more time. Unlocking your phone when you’re not looking right at it isn’t great.,3
att.com,iphone,"I had my phone for a week so far I’m not impressed with the service I’m getting I’m not sure what’s going on it always searching for service when trying to use the internet or social media, even in the city I have issues with it loading today I recieved a text message 40 min after it was sent to me, my iPhone 6pus had better service than this one, going in tomorrow to see what att could do about it or return it",3
att.com,iphone,"This phone is SUPER fast. If you think it the phone will already complete the task. The touch screen is awesome and great display. I do NOT miss the home button at all. Face recognition is SUPER fast and more reliable than finger print.

att.com,iphone,"Was a little insitated to change my iPhone 7 Plus for the X. The best decision ever. At first was confused always looking for the home button. But after a day, I dont even miss it. So flawless and smooth, everybody complements the phone and pictures taken with this phone.

att.com,iphone,Don’t do it Don’t buy it Don’t lease it,1
att.com,iphone,I upgraded from the iPhone 7s. It is definitely a better model iPhone. The battery is a major upgrade and I love that it stays charge so much longer. The facial recognition is different from the thumb scan but it’s not a negative feature. The only thing that’s an adjustment is the way to take a screen shot. Sometimes I accidentally take screenshots. Other than that it is a lot better than the iPhone 7s.,5
att.com,iphone,"Just not really worth it. I upgraded because my 7 broke...hard getting used to the new operating commands and the size is larger than necessary...it’s a phone, not an iPad. Anyway, no other real surprises...just more of the same...",2
att.com,iphone,"Upgraded my 8 plus to the IPhone X everything I expected it to be but for just one shortfall.... Battery life.... Slightly smaller feel in comparison to my former 8 plus even with my Otterbox case...easy navigation, the facial recognition is a great plus and no more fussing with the finger ID. And of course the Great Service and personal attention you get when you go to your Corporate AT&T Store.",4
att.com,iphone,"I got the phone as an upgrade from my 7 plus. I am usually super impressed with the new phones. This one, not so much. I am not a fan of the camera nor the buttonless screen. I also was very comfortable with my the size of my old phone.. but the X is just weird. I havent been a fan of recent apple products, and I guess I am not a fan of the new phone either. Maybe if there was a 10 plus? Who knows?",3
att.com,iphone,I cant say many thing good abut this phone nothing wrong with phone i thing software not like befor i mean i phone 7 was the best after 8 and this have many problam when i have i phone sevan evan last five month dont good.,1
att.com,iphone,"I was very reluctant to buy this phone because of some negative feedback on the missing home button, the new Face ID recognition etc etc. I got so used to not having the home button that this new swiping as a hint me but is way better besides that the screen is all the he way around. In addition, the face recognition is great to sign on to all my accounts. I recommend the IPhone X. Great phone.",5
att.com,iphone,"This is a great new phone and the path to the future. Cool new features (I know Samsung had most of them already), but now Apple does it with flair. If you don't like change, you wont like it, but get used to change!",5
att.com,iphone,Love the phone it has great battery life !! Nice and sleek fit!! Face ID is super amazing quick and easy to access the phone. The switching around of the features definitely gives it a level up its still the same iPhone just with a twist it made it fun to relearn the functions of the X. It made the experience new completely. I am taking it for what it is and enjoying it Apple is truly THE BEST,5
att.com,iphone,It is hard getting use to the New IPhone and it’s features so many to choose from but now that I have gotten use to them I am absolutely in love with it and if you come right down to it it’s the best IPHONE EVER if you reading this definitely buy it and Apple isn’t playing me to say this I have always had an Android phone and I like them but my Iphone is the best phone I have ever had !!!!!!!,5
att.com,iphone,I absolutely LOVE my iPhone X!! The face recognition is extremely fast! Then only thing I don’t like is after the face recognition unlocks the phone you still have to swipe up to open the phone. The processor is extremely fast! I don’t like how small the phone is. The notch doesn’t bother me at all and not having a home button took maybe 8 hours to get used to. Overall a great purchase!,5
att.com,iphone,"I’ve always evolved with the sizes of the iphones over the years. I just switched from my iPhone 7 to the iPhone X. It’s prefect, I could never get feel for a plus that feels like a mini iPad. So the C is just right. Getting us eto the changes as well. I love how sleek it is and I have a case that doesn’t hide that. Overall I love my new phone and I’d recommend it to fellow apple users!",5
att.com,iphone,"Not impressed at all with the x, I’m miss my 6plus may be trading it back in and try the moto, I like their accesorie option. Apple need to step their game up... I give it a 6 out of 10 at best",2
att.com,iphone,"Love the camera on new phone. Of course, night photos are still not good but they day ones are perfect. Screen and size of the phone is perfect. I was little concerned about not having button but it is super easy to transition. Another con is that some of the applications don’t seem to be adjusted for the X, like viber and cannon app I use for my camera, other than that, awesomness :)",5
att.com,iphone,Why is it smaller than a plus? I don’t get it. Even the face recognition gets annoying. Not my smartest purchase.,1
att.com,iphone,If you’re looking for something new.... don’t spend the money on the IPhone X. Get the 8 or stick with your 7 Plus. Not enough features to warrant the cost of. Save the money and take a cruise.,3
att.com,iphone,"The phone is great! I can do everything I have in the past with my other phones, but now I don’t need to use my finger to punch in a code or to use my finger print. At first it feels weird to hold a smaller unit compares to the iPhone Plus models, but surprisingly the screen is bigger... mind blowing!
I can go on and on, but it is best for you to get your hands on one and enjoy.",5
att.com,iphone,I am going to return it and get the 8 the only difference about this phone is the home button is gone and the facial recognition. Since I am use to the the Plus this phone is also too small.,2
att.com,iphone,"I absolutely love my phone! It's so fun and so glad I finally upgraded. With all my facial changes (make up, eye glasses etc) I noticed that my phone doesn't unlock all the time like it's supposed to or like it did initially at least. That's slightly disappointing.. Although the camera quality is REMARKABLE. The design and sleekness of the phone is great. Glad i made the decision.",5
att.com,iphone,I usually don't write reviews and how this helps someone out. I've had iPhones since the very first one and battery life has always been the biggest issue for me as I use my phone all day for work. But the iPhone X has an incredible battery life. Now I can use the phone all day and at midnight still have around 30-40%. That alone justifies the price these things cost these days!!,5
att.com,iphone,"The new X is well worth the money. Very fast and the new additions are very fun. Just wish with all the money the X cost a customer,that Apple would offer air pods or a better headset",4
att.com,iphone,Excellent phone works really well especially in the dark the face recognition is amazing. compared to the other phones they did it a little better on the battery. love this new phone.,5
att.com,iphone,"Apple iPhone X is a great phone. Specially when facial recognition comes in handy with Apple Pay in certain places. Also, I like the fact the screen is bigger for my huge hands! Also, I like the fact how, I’m not over hitting letters when I actually meant the other letter. I like how the flashlight when I turn the phone on to get light for walking in the movies comes in handy.",5
att.com,iphone,"I’ve had the iPhone 3GS 4s 5c 6+ 7+ and now the X. It’s the best one of all of them. I had issues with the 4s battery, 5c build 6+ and 7+ being buggy and have had no issues with the X. It remind of the 4s solid premium feeling phone good weight to it ...faceid is great I can’t imagine using touchid ever again. My only gripe is the notch I hate it but other than that it’s great",5
att.com,iphone,I went from an iPhone 6 Plus to the iPhone X. The display and sound quality from the phone is awesome! I love the Face ID and Animojis! Switching was definitely a good choice.,1
att.com,iphone,Face recognition is awesome. Love the screen and the size is just right.,5
att.com,iphone,"Great phone, very quick with a slight learning curve. It does everything they claim! Great sound, I replaced my 6s with it and the difference feels like a decade! a bit on the expensive side, I was needing a new phone and my gut tells me another Xs or 11 is coming soon...the price for the newest technology I guess. Def a great buy, it lives up to the hype if you have the $$$",4
att.com,iphone,"Can’t think of any flaws in this iPhone X. Speakers and sound are perfect. Typing ability-smooth and easy and accurate. User interface very intuitive and powerful and efficient. Camera is Also wonderful with super clear and beautiful photos and videos. Very easy to use functions. Beautifully clear, bright and large-enough screen. Love the 256gb storage. Sharp looking design.",5
att.com,iphone,"Big upgrade over my IPhone 6s, but very pricey. Needs to have lower price, Apple isn’t hurting that much. Notch on top is very distracting, needs to go on future models. Apple needs to figure that one it. Pretty loyal Apple consumer, nice to upgrade but could have had a lot more improvements. Also needs to incorporate a stylus like Samsung, believe me would sell like crazy.",4
att.com,iphone,"Perfect phone for most hands, great display, very fast. Make sure to buy a good cover and screen protector, 'cause if it is dropped, it isn't going to be cheap to fix.",5
att.com,iphone,"Like all the other iPhones that I've owned, this phone functions perfectly. I've even got used to working without a home button fairly quickly. My only negative opinion at this time is the missing zoom for texting and the icons on the home page. That was a great feature on my other iPhones and can't think of a good reason why this feature was discontinued on the iPhone X.",4
att.com,iphone,"I was worried about the price and size since my last phone was 6 plus, but actually kind of nice to go smaller. There is a greenish hugh around edge but I think it's from the glass. Doesn't seem to effect anything. Not sure if it's a flaw? Been looking on reviews but no one has posted an issue with it. Face recognition is nice. All in all nice phone and have lots to learn",5
att.com,iphone,"I am absolutely thrilled with this phone! I was a little hesitant at first - converting from an iPhone 7, but the lack of a home button has been no problem at all! It is super easy to use, the camera is phenomenal, and there are lots of neat little features I continue to discover! I would recommend this phone to anyone considering an upgrade! The larger screen is amazing!",5
att.com,iphone,"Full disclosure: I am coming from a Galaxy S8. Now that info is out of the way I truly believe the IPhone X is leap years behind android. I have owned my IPhone 6s for a few years now and love it! The difference is the price point. I’m ok with a few quirks and a few missing features at half the price. I expect perfection at the price point this phone comes in at. And to be perfectly clear, the build quality and camera are amazing! Sadly, that’s about where the greatness wears off with this device. There are so many dozens of useful features missing from this device that any android device would have its laughable. That would be entirely due to Apple wanting to play it safe and make your device dummy proof. There isn’t even an actual file system that’s accessible to the user!! All in all, I can say with confidence stay far away f I’m this device. Save your money and get a flagship android device. You’ll be glad you did.",2
att.com,iphone,"I went from an Iphone6S Plus to the X, and while the phone has some cool new features my biggest complaint is missing the home key- I am constantly turning on Siri and taking screen shot because I hold the phone by the sides and the buttons on the side perform same actions as the home button once did. I’ve onky had the phone 2 weeks .. possible I’ll get use to it ?",3
att.com,iphone,"The iPhone X is great. I loved my iPhone 7 and it served me well, but after upgrading, I wouldn't go back without a fight. I think everyone who hasn't worked with one fears the facial recognition thing. Well, it just works. And going home buttonless??? A breeze. After a few days you will stop poking for one and just swipe automatically. I enjoy he extra screen area.",5
att.com,iphone,"I have had a iPhone for the longest I know, this thing just sucks, I have a green line on the side of the screen also the vibration stop working, now it makes a weird noise, it’s more like a short circuit, I have the phone for a week and now this.",1
att.com,iphone,"THIS IS THE WORST PHONE IVE EVER OWNED! it’s slow, never loads anything, freezes up, doesn’t register when I press buttons I hate it beyond words.",1
att.com,iphone,"The FaceID works great and gets better as more apps support it. The size is an improvement over the 6 Plus, with bigger screen on smaller phone. The processor is so fast I had to adjust my gameplay on Angry Birds. Can't rate the camera (so I hope it doesn't give it 0 stars) because I have not taken a picture but did play with the optical zoom and it is very good.",5
att.com,iphone,"I don't really like the IPhone X. If I wanted an Android, I would have bought one. I wish I would have kept my 7+. It is not user friend, I hate freaking swiping. Bring back the fingerprint recognition. Most offices do not allow cameras.",2
att.com,iphone,"I’m so disappointed, I get this phone with more capacity and it’s freezing most of the time. And when I’m in WhatsApp application all the time is trying make connections, the same with safari. Should I go to att store to returned and change it for something good at least? Thanks",1
att.com,iphone,"This is by far the best IPhone so far. I love everything about it, it is so smooth and so awesome to use! I am so happy that I have this phone and I recommend anyone that is deciding between the IPhone 8 and the IPhone X to get this phone! Actually, I recommend android users to switch to this phone, it is much better!! Oh and the speed is AMAZING, so fast!",2
att.com,iphone,"The iPhone X is overall beautifully designed, excellent camera, Face ID is kool, intuitivemy brilliant without the home button!",5
att.com,iphone,Apple continues to make this product even easier to use. The facial recognition software recognizes me with and without my eyeglasses. No buttons on the front make for easier navigation with gestures only. This version is the best yet. ATT made it easy to exchange my iPhone 7 using the same box that the iPhone X arrived in and a prepaid parcel post label.,5
att.com,iphone,"The iPhone 10 is great, I like the camera editing effects, I like the size because it can still fit in my pocket. The one detail that they did change that is inconvenient is the ear phones. It went from the AC adapter to the normal iPhone charger connection so you can't charge and listen to music at the same time. Otherwise, I'm enjoying the upgrade.",5
att.com,iphone,"When I first set eye on the iPhone X I knew it would be my next purchase that would be amazing! Hands down love everything about the device and most importantly the battery life. I’m always on my device rather it’s to check blogs, stocks or even creating documents on the go and knowing that I can in entire day with a good 45% left is really incredible!",5
att.com,iphone,"I think this is a really good phone. It took some adjustment to my habits, but I am glad I made the switch from the iPhone 7. Face ID works every time and is MUCH faster than Touch ID. New features like the camera and the hard-press keyboard functions are great. Screen is much bigger, so one-handed operation is harder but I never did that much anyway.",5
att.com,iphone,The iPhone X is a at least 2 steps up from the iPhone 7 I exchanged for it. Facial recognition simplifies opening the phone and the gesture driven functions of the phone are extremely easy to master. The edge to edge display enhances all interactions with the phone's apps and utilities. The enhanced camera is an added bonus. Couldn't be happier.,5
att.com,iphone,"Horrible phone! Taking a picture is a nightmare, holding two buttons to snap a picture... who designed this?",2
att.com,iphone,This is the best by far Apple has done in a while. Other then the durability issue. This is a flat out win,5
att.com,iphone,"Overall I like it. I think what I like the least is the face recognition for unlock. I miss being able to reach across the table and unlock with my finger, now I have to pick it up or bend over it. Just a lot less convenient at times. Some of the swiping features are awkward or at least I’m not use to it yet. Besides that everything else is great.",4
att.com,iphone,"The features are of course a plus but the size and weight killed it for me. Im used to the Plus versions of Iphone and this was like downsizing to a 6, even tho everyone keeps saying the screen is bigger but not the phone returned and just got the 8plus with my upgrade until they release a plus size version of this phone i will stick with my 8plus",3
att.com,iphone,Don’t have time for a lengthy review has a numerous amount of bugs in all the pre installed applications,1
att.com,iphone,I really do enjoy the phone overall. It’s very cool. The only thing when setting up your Face ID is make sure to yawn in case you’re like me and get tired and yawn while using your phone so it’ll unlock then as well!! Mine wouldn’t unlock the first time I set it up cuz I didn’t open my mouth during the setup but the second time it worked great!!,5
att.com,iphone,"Thus far I really enjoy this phone. Having come from an iPhone 5, it is a dramtically noticeable improvement when it comes to usability and speed. My one complaint so far is that I wish tutorials were a little more comprehensive on the phone's technology and capabilities. Felt pretty glossed over in that area. Otherwise a very welcome upgrade.",5
att.com,iphone,"Just like anything, it takes a little getting use to when you’ve had the previous for so long! But now I’m so happy I went X than 8Plus. My ultimate decision was a video review from cNet. Beyond the technology, my big sale point was the screen size! Basically same screen size on a smaller body! So much easier to handle and in your pocket!",5
att.com,iphone,"I started using my iPhone X on November 11 2017 and this is the best cell phone I have ever had. I have had cell phones for over 30 years and from where I started to iPhone X is unbelievable. Out of the box, set it up in about 30 minutes, and the battery life is unbelievable. You will not be disappointed it is everything I expected and more.",5
att.com,iphone,"The facial recognition works great. The sound is much better with this phone too! Of course the big screen display is very nice. Camera is awesome! And the phone is really fast, so when you push a hot link just touch it quickly or it won’t activate...it’s that fast! I feel like this phone is somehow is on a higher level than other iPhones.",5
att.com,iphone,My last iPhone was a six. The X isn’t user friendly. I keep saying maybe I will get use to it. Jus to close out apps is difficult. The face recognition on the apps like my banking apps don’t always work. And the phone overall is slow to respond. I’ve always had and iPhone along with all other apple products but this is isn’t as easy to use.,3
att.com,iphone,"I’ve had the iPhone X for a little over a week. This phone is a workhorse and not much it can’t do! I have to admit I’m impressed.. I thought I would miss the size of my 8 plus but I haven’t because of how fast, smooth and solid the X is. No home button wasn’t a problem either as I quickly adapted to the new interface. Ok Apple - I LOVE it!",5
att.com,iphone,"I went from the 7 Plus to the X and it took a little while to get adjusted to the smaller overall size especially the keyboard. However, the device itself is smooth, the response is excellent and it appears to process data, etc pretty quickly. This phone would be perfect if they made it in the Plus size but overall, I like it alot so far.",5
att.com,iphone,"Beautiful phone. Nice feel to it, good size and overall happy with my purchase.",5
att.com,iphone,"Certainly not the quality one would expect, especially at this price point!",1
att.com,iphone,"Coming from a plus, I feel like I've been sent back to the original.",1
att.com,iphone,"I’m a long time Apple user and upgraded from a 6s to the iPhone X. Only thing I have a bone to pick about is that it won’t connect to my current Bluetooth headphones or my car Bluetooth. I know, first world problems. But why do I have to buy all new accessories or car to get things to work. Maybe a trip to the Apple store would help.",4
att.com,iphone,"I upgraded from the 6s to the X due to the updates ruining my 6s. Although it was unplanned, this was probably the best move.
The X delivers. It’s screen is actually BIGGER than the plus models. Only reason people will refute that is because the plus models include large borders around the phone.
Not once has facial recognition failed for me.
The smoothness of switching between apps is great.
It’s very fast. The camera is by far the best I’ve used on a phone. I’m big on photo editing and touching up photos for marketing purposes, and I feel no need to with this.
As for the price, get with the times people. Prices of phones have increased since the original iPhone era. For what phones can do these days, it’s justifiable. I have owned a MacBook since 2008 until it recently bit the dust and this has taken the place of it. Out of the office since I work in Sales, this does everything I need to do.
I give this a 5/5 on all aspects.",5
att.com,iphone,"Before I bought the IPhone X I read almost every review I could. I saw people complaining about the phone size, the screen size, the durability, and the fact that some apps don’t take up the whole screen. WELL I went from the iPhone 7 Plus and I love the phone being small with the screen being bigger I can still see the same as I did on the 7 pulse but I also don’t have to worry about it not fitting in my hand very well. I’ve already dropped this thing twice and there’s nothing wrong with it at all (I don’t have the glass screen protector and a speck case though. Also most of the apps do fit to my screen perfectly the only one I have seen not is my schools app which makes sense cause they probably aren’t to worried about updating it just for the new phone. I love this phone though very easy to use, really cool features, and the camera is TO DIE FOR. I really like not having a home button, it actually makes it easier and the facial ID works really fast.",5
att.com,iphone,I absolutely love this phone. I couldn’t be any happier with it. I had it originally with a different carrier but ended up having to downgrade to the iPhone 6 and missed my X. Finally got a new one when I switched to AT&T and I can’t tell you how much of a difference it makes. The photos alone are a reason to upgrade to this phone.,5
att.com,iphone,I bought the Apple watch series 3 and the iPhone X on the same day. Both products live up to every inch of their advertisements. I have never owned a phone with so many features and capabilities with such ease of operation. So do yourself a favor and make your life easier..........go get the iphone X. You won't be disappointed!,5
att.com,iphone,"I love this phone, the no home button and face recognition is what makes me so happy with this choice. Even though the sales were low and they are going to discontinue the model did disappoint me, as now my week old iphonex is obsolete... Go Apple, they should give us a trade in value for the new phones coming out this summer. JS",5
att.com,iphone,"Overall pretty good. Nothing extravagant. If you are accustomed to an iPhone plus, I certainly would not recommend. The full screen feature is overrated and pretty much for the home screen and some videos on you tube. If the X came as a plus, I'd certainly get it. I think the advertisement for the full screen effect is misleading.",3
att.com,iphone,The phone is not very user friendly. You have to get online to find out how you can hang up a phone call. The phone is very slow. There are so many issues not enough room to list them.,1
att.com,iphone,This phone is everything I expected it to be. Love it!,5
att.com,iphone,"Tons of features but impossible to share with people that have not equal technology. Impossible to upload on Instagram or FB great videos, too heavy. The camaras are great but when using block itself and I needed to shut down completly the cell and restart to continue using. So, too expensive and it works so-so. Not very happy.",3
att.com,iphone,"So far, this has been my favorite Iphone! It was a little awkward not having the home button, but other than that everything has been awesome! I had a 6SPlus, so the X's screen is smaller, but I actually prefer that. Fits in pockets and purses better! The camera is amazing...just saying! A definite must upgrade kind of deal!",5
att.com,iphone,Not very happy with it or Not wort the money,1
att.com,iphone,"I have a phone that works, More than I can say for the phone that I had before. It was a 6S and it was giving me trouble nonstop. I’m so grateful to have this phone and I really think that it is user-friendly and I like the size. Granted, the price tag was extreme, but since I make my money with my phone it was well worth it.",5
att.com,iphone,My husband and I both got the new iPhone X as a Christmas gift to each other. We both are very active and use them for work. They are fast and love the Face ID log in for access and our apps. Camera is amazing and the features create beautiful picture options. Still learning all the great new features but so glad we got them.,5
att.com,iphone,"I really like the new iPhone X. The functions of the phone are great, the one thing I’m disappointed in is the screen size. It’s not as wide as my iPhone 6s Plus, even thought the screen stretch’s the whole length of the phone everything on the screen is smaller. It’s hard to go backwards. I hope the next phone out is bigger.",4
att.com,iphone,"In the two weeks that I have had phone I have been on other website and Youtube and have found many new, hidden, and unspoken of features the iPhone X has to offer. I excited too see what new and upcoming features I find!! I was afraid of leaving the iPhone 7 plus for a smaller phone but it powerful. Fast and quick charging.",5
att.com,iphone,I switched from android to this phone and I love it. Liked the difference. Not a solid ANDROID HATER By any means. Just wanted something different. I am kinda jealous of the upcoming 9 though for the Android. Honestly may have waited had I known sooner. Facial recognition is sweet on the X. Won’t be disappointed.,5
att.com,iphone,"The iPhong demonstrates facial recognition. I love the capacity of the 256 GB; it provides space and I can utilize it's storage for additional information e.g. movies, files and music. I don't like the idea of swapping just yet, maybe a finger print along with facial recognition is another ideal addition to it's technology.",4
att.com,iphone,"Overheating in two minutes,useless",1
att.com,iphone,I’ve owned the iPhoneX for a couple weeks now and I love it. My last phone was an iPhone 6 Plus. The screen size of the iPhoneX is larger than the 6 Plus even though the phone is smaller because the screen is edge-to-edge. I love that. And no more Home button. Yea! I can’t enough about how much I’m loving the new iPhoneX.,5
att.com,iphone,"This is my first iphone, I have always used androids and been very happy with them. I love the iphoneX It is so much fun to use. It does everything I need and the camera is amazing. I didn't expect to like the iphone X as much as I do due to some of the reviews I've read but it's been an easy switch and I love the phone.",5
att.com,iphone,I got a brand new iPhone x and the phone does not work properly i don’t know was going on with apple. Is a shame that i pay all these money for a defective phone.,1
att.com,iphone,I really enjoy the new look of the iPhone X. I really enjoy having the facial recognition. I am glad that I went with the iPhone X. I highly recommended this phone for both the young and young at heart. It offers something for everyone. I definitely don’t want to forget about the battery life on this phone-its great.,5
att.com,iphone,I have a Samsung S9+ and I hate to admit it BUT the iPhone X is better than I thought. This phone was a gift. It is smaller than the S9+ but it is packed with many surprises and fast. I’m still not a fan of the notch but I’ll get over it. It may be a little pricey but it’s worth every extra $$. No regrets here!!!,4
att.com,iphone,"After having all of the iphones, Apple did it Right with this one. The Iphone X is wonderful.....great display, easy to use and a great sleek look. There is a little bit of a learning curve, learning the way of using the phone but its very simple, once you get the hang of it. Totally recommend this iPhone!!",5
att.com,iphone,Great features with iOS 11. Beautiful phone. Just the right weight. Beautiful screen. Dual charging options out of the box. Face ID is great; not much slower than touch with finger rest on iPhone 7 Plus. I would buy one for everyone in my family with confidence but I enjoy being slightly cooler than them.,5
att.com,iphone,I’ve been an iPhone fan and user since the first one came out. Each one has been better and stronger and the X has not disappointed. Took a bit to get used to no Home button but now that I have I wish my iPad worked like the phone. Face ID has worked flawlessly. Quit reading this and just go get one.,5
att.com,iphone,"Great, beautiful phone however I returned it because I decided I liked the body of the plus sized phones better.... I’m hoping next year that come out with a bigger screened version and I will get that one! However the camera was amazing and I did love the phone! Just didn’t like the small body size.",5
att.com,iphone,This is my first Apple product. I purchased it so I can pair up my new hearing aids to it and use the latest technology. I am so impressed and really have found it easy to learn how to use all of its features. I am an older lady but have had no trouble adapting and am in love with my new iPhone X!,5
att.com,iphone,"It was hard to choke down the price tag, but bumping up from the 5s to the X was a great choice. The camera on this phone is amazing! That alone is worth the price. And I don’t miss the home button like I thought I would. I’ve been using the phone for about a week and I’m really happy with it so far.",5
att.com,iphone,The phone is amazing. The only thing I don’t like is the way you completely close apps. I like the swipe up method better than the hold down and X out of it. Just takes longer and is more difficult. The batter life is phenomenal and the facial recognition is awesome. Just an overall amazing phone.,5
att.com,iphone,"I always loved iPhones. I had a iPhone 7 Plus and upgraded to the iPhone X. I am very impressed with the FaceID, the battery life is great, it’s fast, the screen is phenomenal and a lot of other awesome high tech features. I am sooooo happy with my new iPhone. Thank you Apple! Don’t wait go for it!!",5
att.com,iphone,The latest iPhone is always nice to have. The facial recognition is a major plus. I have working hands. So the finger recognition on the 6s+ was not always adequate. Even with or withought me glasses the facial recognition still recognizes my face. The new camera fetures are a major upgrade as well.,5
att.com,iphone,"It took a couple of days to get used to the lack of a home button and the various swipes to get places, but once I got used to it, it is a very nice phone and intuitively easy. I had also been skeptical of the facial recognition, but that works amazingly well and quickly. All in all, a great phone.",5
att.com,iphone,This is apple worst decision every,1
att.com,iphone,I’ve had it about a month now and am loving every minute of it!! People are just to picky anymore and don’t know how to properly use a phone. The Face ID is lightening fast and so is the processor. Screen is amazingly bright and vibrant as well. Camera is awesome as well! The design is Very sleek!,5
att.com,iphone,I was perfectly happy with my IPhone 6 Plus but after reading numerous rave reviews I made the upgrade. What a fantastic phone! With too many new favorite features than I have room to mention! My absolute favorite is the camera! I film a ton of music shows and the new camera design is heavenly!!!,5
att.com,iphone,The I phone x feels completely like a different phone. I love the facial unlocking. I love the swiping apps. I do love the fact that the button is gone and have fewer steps to open. I love how my life proof case fits the x. The look it has. The screen is larger than bigger phones. I just love it.,5
att.com,iphone,The screen is awesome. Love that it’s the same size screen as the 8s Plus but the phone itself is the size of the 8s. the pictures are super clear and crisp. And i like the new features of no home button and the talking emojis. Lol. So much fun. I hate the hefty price tag but i do love the phone.,5
att.com,iphone,"I’m not a person who goes and buys the latest gadget every time one comes out. Usually I buy an older refurbished model and keep that for years. But since My boyfriend of three years ended things, I decided to do some retail therapy. I’m so glad I did because the new iPhone X rocks! I may never fully learn all the cool things that can be done with it, for instance I need to see what I am doing wrong with saving files on iCloud and accessing them on the phone, but I have done a few animoji texts which are so cool! I’m not a very photogenic person but I will try out the jammin’ camera when I get a chance. I dig the face id aspect and not having to type in user ids or passwords on occasion. Not sure if I am ready to store payment options through Apple pay yet, but it’s nice that it will be there if I ever do. I’m so grateful to AT&T for giving me the extra gbs on my data plan and giving me the otterbox defender case for being a loyal customer. Never knew I was entitled to so many great perks!",5
att.com,iphone,Love this phone. the only thing that an be annoying is having to pick up the phone to unlock it. the fingerscan was easier to use to check your phone quickly. its more difficult to look at your phone discreetly without the fingerscan. overall great product. love all the other new features.,5
att.com,iphone,I bought this iPhone X for myself and it is super great!!!! I upgraded from iPhone 6p and you can really see the difference in speeds. The menus change very quickly and the 4k ultra on the video is fantastic.I like the full screen across the phone as well. You cannot go wrong with this iPhone.,5
att.com,iphone,I thought that the X would be hard to operate because I had become really accustomed to the 6 Plus and didn’t really utilize that device to the full capacity but I am enjoying getting acclimated with the latest technology that Apple has released with the X. It’s definitely a great toy to have.,5
att.com,iphone,If you are looking for a new iphone experience the X is the way to go i know its expensive but i think its worth it,5
att.com,iphone,I love this phone. The size is the perfect balance for someone who loves the bigger look but enjoys the slightly smaller size. The interface is surprising easy to learn adjust to. The camera is an amazing upgrade! I love using all the different features to enhance the photos of my family.,5
att.com,iphone,Didn’t really hear much about the phone but figured I’d enjoy the camera and was interested in the Face ID. After getting the phone number I’m very impressed. A week later I still look for reasons to be on the phone. Only feature that’s I’ve not taken advantage of is the wireless charging.,5
att.com,iphone,I am in love with my iPhone X. There are a few things that will need to be fixed. It gets stuck in the landscape screen. Which makes it unlockable. The operating system freezes often. I don’t think the problem is with the phone. I believe it is a problem with the iOS 11. Fix this please!!!,3
att.com,iphone,"Recently just update to the iPhone X. I say worth the buy so much faster, reliable, battery is a life saver. I do miss the two different ports for headphones and charger though. Having one was unnecessary and a cheap move on Apple really. But other than that it’s a great tech savvy device",5
att.com,iphone,I upgraded from an iPhone 6 to the iPhone X. I love it the camera takes awesome pictures it’s fast and has a great battery life. Apple products are easy to use and the functions are very similar. I have not had the time to explore all the functions yet but the ones I have used are great.,5
att.com,iphone,If u like apple. This is the best there is. But if your a andriod person you will always hate the iPhone.,5
att.com,iphone,I was hesitant to buy this phone because of some bad reviews. I am so happy I did. It is the perfect phone for me. It is small enough for my pocket yet the screen is big. I don’t miss the home key at all. It is sleek and easy to keep clean. And it takes great pictures. I love it.,5
att.com,iphone,"First, the service - it is wonderful. Be it in person at an ATT store or on the phone, the treatment is cheerful, helpful and timely. My plans keep improving with every ""visit. The iPhone X - BEST iPhone yet (and I've had EACH one sine #1 - even the 8 plus). Keep up the great work ATT.",5
att.com,iphone,"It’s really good, screen so crisp it’s paper, so smooth, so fast, somehow faceid so fast, it outplaced my iPad 70%, my previous iPhone forgotten, my laptop 50%. So good it is embarrassing expressing love for a device. No way I am replacing that one for a while, love is forever, right?",5
att.com,iphone,"The phone has much room for improvement. It has locked on my twice. I can be texting and all of a sudden, the screen goes back to the home screen and I have to start over. Closing programs can be a hassle if you don't swipe just right. Sometimes this can take several attempts.",3
att.com,iphone,"After sum bad reviews i was like, people are entitled to there own opinion and i shall say i have grown to love iphone x more and more the picture pixel quality is A-1 and i simply adore the face id just look and BOOM the phone and certain apps open with just a bomb selfie look :)",4
att.com,iphone,Great phone and amazing camera and qualities. However I do not recommend this iPhone for older people or people who aren't exactly tech-savvy. It is hard to use. Especially at first. And im 23 and have had iPhones since I was 14. I love it tho and I'm happy once I got used to it.,4
att.com,iphone,I do enjoy the smaller size with same screen size. My only problem is the face recognition. If I’m in a rush it was much easier putting my thumb on home screen button but there’s no longer one of those gotta get ur face at good angle to open phone. Otherwise everything is great,4
att.com,iphone,"Don't listen to negative reviews! I transitioned from an Android phone to the iPhone X and wish I had done it earlier. The Swipe to Open feature is easy to get used to works quite well. The phone is still new to me, so I am not familiar with all features, but I'm learning.",5
att.com,iphone,"I have had IPhones since the 4. The IPhone X is the most amazing user friendly phone yet. I must admit I had to google some things to use it. The no home button requires some learning, but once you learn it’s even easier to use than any of its predecessors. I love this phone.",5
att.com,iphone,Well the new update on the phone prevents you while using a Bluetooth to read incoming texts. When you prompt the Bluetooth to access your new texts it says you need to unlock your phone this is very annoying and difficult to do while driving I am very disappointed with this,3
att.com,iphone,"Love the iPhone X, Perfect size just wish they had it in gold or rose gold!!",5
att.com,iphone,"I am in love. I was a bit nervous about the face id feature, but its been better than expected. It took a bit of getting used to as I was so stuck on the old Iphone, but once I got the hang everything about the X, I am glad I went for it. If you're considering it, do it!!",5
att.com,iphone,I love this phone. I upgraded from a 6s and I wouldn't go back. It's super simple to navigate and surprisingly easy to get used to no home button. The graphics are amazing and the battery lasts much longer than my last iPhone. I would highly suggest this phone to anyone!,5
att.com,iphone,"Apple, please don’t bring back the home button! I don’t use face recognition or pass codes ( NEVER HAVE!) This phone is smoking fast and very responsive to my touch! One flick up IS SO EASY! I’m looking forward to the X-Plus in the fall! Then it will be a perfect phone!",5
att.com,iphone,"Hhhmmm... After a long, excited wait to finally go in and get it, I’m not as impressed as I expected to be. Coming from a 6s Plus 64gb, I don’t feel like this is an “upgrade”. Pros: smaller, huge storage space, louder speakers Cons: smaller, difficult to get used to the changes in function, can’t stand the function to return to/view previous screen(s), glass housing stresses me out (always feeling like I have to be extra gentle with handling it), battery life feels almost worse if not the same, battery percentage no longer shows on upper right corner (no option to change either), you have to swipe down to see it, and the price tag. As each day goes by, my feeling is the same... that I’ll be returning the phone within my 14-day timeframe. Luckily, I still have my 6s Plus to go back to (whew!). Now that’s a great phone. I’ll give 3 stars because the X is not a bad phone, but it’s also not the best phone - for me (and I’m a huge tech-fanatic). This is one case where the newer isn’t better. But always an Apple fan!",3
att.com,iphone,"I was uncertain about the size at first but this phone is actually easier to use larger. I got it as an upgrade for my fiancé and he's in love with it. Happy the design, amount of storage, it's user friendly. He is constantly on the phone and the battery lasts forever.",5
att.com,iphone,"Awesome phone, but it is not worth the money that the phone cost.",3
att.com,iphone,Despite it being fragile it’s a neat device. I like that I can use the keyboard better than I did on the iPhone 7. I like the camera so far. I’ve owned the device for 3 days now. I’m still getting use to the functions with it lacking a home button but it’s still cool.,4
att.com,iphone,"What can I say about the newest improvement of the iPhone, it’s sleek, fashionable and puts a new spin on the “boring” old iPhone design. It’s nice to be able to explore a different type of cell phone phone without losing support of my current Apple ecosystem!!! 10/10",5
att.com,iphone,I upgraded from an iPhone 6 and it was a longer process backing up the old phone to iCloud and then restoring to the new one. Other than that due to my ignorance of apple products it turned out okay. I'll stick to android for my phone and let her keep her iPhone.,4
att.com,iphone,I like it it’s new it’s kool been an iPhone user since 08 by far my favorite iPhone camera is amazing so glad att saved my spot to preorder glad I didn’t have to wait until December,5
att.com,iphone,"Have had iPhones since they first came out , from the 3 to the 4s and then the 6 plus , upgraded to the X , oh boy ! Take a lot of getting use to , switching apps and closing apps , everything is different, no home button, not sure if I want to change to the 8 arg",3
att.com,iphone,"I didn’t know if I would like it with being smaller than the plus, but the screen size definitely makes up for it! The swipe instead of the button is so much efficient, the Face ID is the best, The battery life is great, the camera is amazing - I cannot complain!",5
att.com,iphone,I bought this phone back in October of 2018. I don’t regret anything at all. AT&T has a pretty solid network and the phone is fast overall. I’m happy with my purchase :),5
att.com,iphone,"I had an iPhone 6+for several years And liked it very well, but this new one came out and operates faster so I got the iPhone X. Taking a little time to get used to the small differences in operatingit, but so far I’m very happy with it, and it is faster also.",5
att.com,iphone,"I upgraded from the Iphone 7 plus to the Iphone X. Great decision, it fits perfectly in my hand, better for texting. The camera on the X is superb. It is very fast, and reliable, and love the faceid recognition. Had the phone afor about 3 weeks and no regrets.",5
att.com,iphone,"My previous phone was a KYOCERA. Compared to that experience, I have died and gone to heaven. This phone is so responsive and the picture is so clear. I can FaceTime my family that is 10 hours away. It responds immediately when I touch it. I am just thrilled!",5
att.com,iphone,The new X is very aesthetically pleasing. The pictures and videos it takes are very high quality and the full-frontal screen makes is very nice. It is very fast compared to my old iPhone (iPhone 6). We’ll see if it stays fast once the new iPhone comes out...,5
att.com,iphone,I purchase on another accounts and it’s wack,1
att.com,iphone,Over priced unnecessary bells and whistles,1
att.com,iphone,"Great phone. It did not take long to get used to the new hand gestures or Face ID. After a weeks use I would not go back to the old way, much quicker and easier. Small problem with freezing inside of the Directv App. Not sure if it is the phone or the app.",5
att.com,iphone,"This iPhone has won me over times 10, i know you may hear reviews on the camera not being good as the Pixel this and that. All i will say is this iPhone will change tech just like the first one did and btw i love the notch no diff than androids status bar.",5
att.com,iphone,"I don’t like that you have to lift the phone up to your face for it to unlock. When it’s laying flat on a table I miss my fingerprint scanner. Otherwise a great phone. Display, speed, camera are all awesome. Love the size of the phone over the huge pluses.",4
att.com,iphone,"Got this on launch day and honestly can’t believe how much I like it. First, the camera is amazing. That alone is worth the change. Having a screen that is essentially the same size as my 7+ in a phone that fits much better in pocket. Best smartphone yet.",5
att.com,iphone,I was skeptical about using an iPhone without the button and for spending the kind of money I did on this phone. I can say I am very pleasantly surprised and excited to keep using this powerhouse of a phone. Once again Apple outdoes themselves with the X.,5
att.com,iphone,"So far, I would rather have my android back. I like their version of google books better. The IOS won’t let me message on Pinterest. I miss using swipe feature on my keyboard. My emails won’t update in a timely manner (24hrs). FB messenger freezes up.",4
att.com,iphone,I was initially skeptical about this phone compared to the other iPhones or even S8. But I was blown away with the user experience. The facial recognition is unbelievable. S8 boasts of facial and iris recognition but it is just nowhere close to iPhone.,5
att.com,iphone,"I was in the store for another issue. While I was waiting, I played with the iPhone X - WOW! I was smitten and traded my 7plus for the X. Still finding out about all the advantages and features about this phone. Can't praise it enough! GO GET ONE!!!",5
att.com,iphone,"I love the phone, the features I am still learning how to navigate but not much difference. The transfer of data was so easy, it was amazing. The whole face recognition, i love that to unlock the phone. Looking forward to what else this phone can do.",5
att.com,iphone,"I owned a iPhone se came to iPhone X the improvements are speechless, I am in love with my new iPhone X. Never in my life was I excited about a phone till this one came out! The speed the graphics it is without a doubt the greatest phone of our time.",5
att.com,iphone,"I switched from the Samsung S 5 to the I phone X and as not too sure of the switch, but I’m glad I did, There a few more nicer apps available for Android. But the IPhone is so much easier to use and so much smoother. So glad I made the move to Apple",5
att.com,iphone,AT&T sold me a phone that doesn’t work and gave me the run around. Phone was purchased 3 days ago and I still don’t have a working phone. They promised me a phone the next day and charged my credit card for the shipping. I still don’t have a phone.,1
att.com,iphone,All iPhones should be made this way! No home button and a more intuitive IOS. A nice bright contrast OLED screen to view. A great camera that results in me carrying my DSLR less and less. I upgraded from a 7 plus and it’s a world of difference!,5
att.com,iphone,"The Apple iPhone X is an Amazing device, so many features, so much capability. I was skeptical about using facial recognition at first but now I’m sold. The only negative thing I can say is, there aren’t many AR apps out there, but that’ll change",5
att.com,iphone,What can one say about a beautiful phone? I am a die hard iPhone fan and I have been in the AT&T “next” program for a couple years now and when this phone came along I of course jumped at it! I love the new screen real estate and it’s smaller size overall..( my previous phone was the iPhone 7plus) which was a bit too big! This phone is also faster and has loads of useful features! The only complaint I have is that a few of the hidden features are not explained....for example...if you have the phone in your hand and it rings ...the volume drops really low...almost to the point of being a “whisper”...I thought the phone was defective so I made the AT&T person prepare a new phone for me only to find out that the new phone did the same thing! (If the phone rings while it is NOT in your hand the volume is as loud as you set it! The idea I guess is that you don’t need it blasting in your ear if you already know it’s ringing! Ibfelt that the sales person should have known this instead of making me spend another hour activating a different phone!,5
att.com,iphone,I love this phone! The camera quality is fantastic and it fits perfectly in my small hands! I don’t drop my phone on my face anymore! There are still a few glitchy bugs but that’s with any new device! Great job Apple! It was well worth the price!,5
att.com,iphone,"This must be my favorite fun I have ever purchased. Everything is perfect, the size, FaceID, the screen, everything about it I love. The phone feels premium as the sides are stainless steel and the back is glass. Would 100% recommend this phone.",5
att.com,iphone,"Same old iPhone like usual, nothing really new but a much higher price. I do love the screen and how it’s fully fulfilled. I love the camera and the Face ID works flawlessly. It’s very responsive and it’s definitely worth the extra money for it.",5
att.com,iphone,"If you are ready for an upgrade, go ahead and get the iPhone X. This phone is amazing. It has the perfect size. The new iOS is fantastic. So happy I changed it from the iPhone 6. By the way, you get used to not having the home bottom. Enjoy !!!",5
att.com,iphone,"Beautiful, Fast, User-Friendly. The only challenge for me as an iPhone user was getting used to the swipe functions instead of the home button. It only took me a few hours of usage to get past that and acclimated to the swipes. Great phone!",5
att.com,iphone,"I will the you something I'm not a fan of the plus even when I heard it was going to be 5.8' I was skeptical of not preorder cause I really hate big phones specially if it looks like a satellite, love the new iPhone X I don't regret it period.",5
att.com,iphone,I upgraded from an iPhone 6s Plus to the iPhone X and love this phone. It was an easy transition from the 6 to the X and you will get use to the new features quickly. I was torn between the 8 and the X but I'm happy I decided to go with the X,5
att.com,iphone,"I’ve had iPhones for past 10-11 years and this is by far, the best one! It has beautiful resolution, easy touch screen, incredible pictures, everything is flawless. Siri is much better than ever. I am in love and recommend this phone to all!!",5
att.com,iphone,"I love the IphoneX!! At first, I didn't see the differences. When I started to explore and get used to the phone, I realized how much better the display, graphics, camera, speed, and features are! I'm so happy with my new phone!! I love it!!",5
att.com,iphone,"Highly recommend the “X” ... it takes some getting use to without the home button, but the learning curve if you’re an avid iPhone user is fairly quick. Processor is super fast. Camera’s photo quality, as expected, is somewhat disappointing.",5
att.com,iphone,My iPhone X is just ok. My battery life is poor. My battery dies fast. I can’t listen to What’s App voice note messages while I’m on a call. My phone seems slower and I’m not sure about this phone. The pictures are ok nothing to brag about,4
att.com,iphone,"I’ve always been an iPhone guy Pretty much had an iPhone all the way through the 6. This one though (the X) is awesome The camera alone is on point. No more home button though, but like my boy Forest said “One less thang”. I love it.",5
att.com,iphone,At first I was skeptical about upgrading to the X because of the reviews but I dove in head first and took a shot at it. And I don’t regret it. The Face ID is so quick to unlock my phone and I don’t even miss the home button. I love it !,5
att.com,iphone,"Best iPhone yet!! My expectations were exceeded by the sleekness of the design, impressive battery life, and seamless operating system. Also, I found it helpful to buy a front and back tempered glass protector in addition to a phone case.",5
att.com,iphone,"I should have bought an Andriod, this phone is even worse than the last one......",1
att.com,iphone,Since I first aquired an IPHONE nothing on the market comes close to the technology that it has. Every other Phone trys to compete but Apple has the best & to me if you don't own an IPHONE ( You can't afford the ROLLS ROYCE of cellular },5
att.com,iphone,"Even though I was not going to purchase the X, my 6s died. I’m happy now due to the larger storage capacity and larger screen with smaller footprint. Only problem is all my earphones are now unusable with this phone without the adapter.",4
att.com,iphone,"Took a hot minute to get used to the navigation, but the corner to corner screen is awesome! The phones battery is the best any iPhone has had, it’s sleek, and the processor is faster as well. Glad I purchased this over the 8 or 8 plus.",5
att.com,iphone,Upgraded from the iPhone 7 even though I did not need to but did it anyway: battery is as good as my 7 and it is just an awesome phone. I am very pleased with my purchase even though the price could of been lower but overall- Nice phone,5
att.com,iphone,"I have own previous I Phones, and when I up graded they always have newer technology. The I phone X has by far leaped in keeping with today's demands.
AT&T has treated me and my daughter very well. The employees know their stuff.",5
att.com,iphone,I love the iPhone X my only thing is I thought it was bigger than it was and I wish I would’ve waited for the X Pro that’s coming out at top of year. It’s the big version 6.5 size. But far as the phone itself I never had a better phone,5
att.com,iphone,"I took some time to research a couple phones before I decided and I am glad I did,I love my IPhone X.I had an IPhone 6 Plus and wasn’t quite as happy as I should have been and after a couple months of research I chose my IPhone X...",5

att.com,iphone,I love everything about this iPhone X. The picture quality is the best. Especially portrait mode. It’s a little learning curve but so much nicer when you catch on. Long battery life. The only thing they need to improve on is the AR,5
att.com,iphone,The only complaint I have is that I wish apple wouldn’t come out with any new phones so I’ll always have the coolest one. I accidentally take pictures by pressing the top volume and lock screen buttons together (new to the X?).,5
att.com,iphone,"Still adjusting to the size. I should have looked at the dimensions, but I miss my larger 7 plus. I am also trying to get used to the way you close background apps, which is not as easy or intuitive as on the previous models.",3

att.com,iphone,The iPhone X is remarkable! It is technically sound and has features second to none. The facial recognition program is the best I’ve seen and it’s superior to the Samsung 8 plus. You won’t regret buying the iPhone X model!,5
att.com,iphone,"The iPhone X is beautiful, futuristic, and fast. The camera is beyond amazing and so far my experience with iOS 11 has been flawless. Only down fall is the price of the phone. Still I’ll never switch mine back to the 8plus.",4

att.com,iphone,Overall the iPhone X is a good phone however leaves a lot to be desired based on its price point. Features are improved from previous generations however not so much to make this unit worth its hefty price tag.,3

att.com,iphone,Easier to maneuver than the home button on previous phones. Easy to maneuver period. Camera is the bomb. My only issue was the size. Too small for me. I had to go back to the plus. Hoping they make a X Plus.,4
att.com,iphone,Love my new Apple iPhone X. I have small hands and it fits perfectly. I needed a larger screen I could see but the Plus iPhones were a little too wide to fit comfortably in my hand. The X meets but my needs!,5

att.com,iphone,I love the iPhone X! Not hard to use especially not haven’t the home button. Only issue I see is the speakers. They are not as clear as my previous IPhone 7 and I hear this cracking/popping sound. So weird.,5
att.com,iphone,It was time to upgrade my son’s phone. He’s had it now for 4-5 days. He is extremely happy with the new features. The facial recognition is pretty neat. Now I have to get one for my 14 year old daughter.,5
att.com,iphone,This is a great device. The camera is phenomenal and the device just works the way it’s supoosed to. The facial recognition is a nice feature that nearly eliminates having to type in a ps code. I love it.,5
att.com,iphone,This phone is perfect for me. I upgraded from the 7 plus and the phone is smaller so it fits my hand better but the screen is actually bigger than my old phone. Gaming and sound quality is outa this world.,5

att.com,iphone,"I think for the price that you pay for the phone, Apple in my opinion did not change much to warrant the excessive amount that they want to purchase the phone. I should have just got the iPhone 8 or 7.",4

att.com,iphone,The slide & facial recognition is super and so much easier to use and user friendly! Can’t see why anyone would waste money on an 8 when this technology seem to be leaps and bounds ahead of the 8!!!,4
att.com,iphone,Great product! Have other Apple products and this one is wonderful! The phone is beautiful! All my friends with older versions of the iPhone are going to buy the iPhone X. The phone sells itself!,5
att.com,iphone,"This phone is wonderful! Definitley have to get used to a few new things on it, but don't have a bad thing to say about it! The facial recognition is crazy accurate and I love how big the screen is!",5
att.com,iphone,Fast reliable phone with many uses. I like the facial recognition that gives extra hands off features the most. I did fancy the old home button though. Also my phone cracked on the first 3 for drop.,4
att.com,iphone,They phone is actually a really great phone but man is it too pricey! Features are really good but I don’t think it would actually substantiate the price. Would I buy it again? That a definite “NO”!,3
att.com,iphone,Coming from a 7plus I wanted a bigger screen but a smaller package overall. The X fit that dynamics. Feared the home button would be a learning curve but it’s not a big deal. Face recognition rocks.,4
att.com,iphone,"I don’t think it’s worth the money. I’ve had it for about a week and it’s still updating my information on it (music, etc). The camera is better than the others but not as great as it’s advertised.",3
att.com,iphone,"I am a long time Apple user. However, I have to admit Apple's products have gone down since Steve Job. at least it seems to. I was not going to switch from my iPhone 7Plus to X after I watched the Apple's product launch by Tim Cook. it was just disappointed and nothing much 'wow' factors from the way presented. However.... after using this phone for a few weeks, I realized how advanced and well made, packed with crazy but saddle technologies in this compact iPhone X. iPhone 7 Plus was ok, but hated the size. Learned X's screen size is actually bigger or similar than 7 plus but the size of a phone is smaller. - that is PERFECT. Camera quality with Studio lighting is amazing, they should have presented more clearly how they have achieved another break-through phone. If Steve Job had presented, the product would likely be treated as 'wow- product'. Although some old app developers have not caught up with the new X screen and tech that I won't be able to use them, it is no issue. Very impressed by this phone, especially comparing from the latest Samsung. Highly recommended.",5
att.com,iphone,"I personally think this is the best iPhone apple has ever came out with. I love that it’s not as big as the iPhone plus but the screen is still bigger. Great job, smooth and runs absolutely great!",5

att.com,iphone,"For my daughter for Christmas, she loves it. She especially loves the quality and high level of technology that the camera has. She also uses it with her virtual reality set. It is awesome.",5
att.com,iphone,The iPhone X is a wonderful phone. Granted with each update it improves. The camera and quality is superb and you’ll enjoy the extra features. If you’re looking to upgrade look boo further.,5
att.com,iphone,It’s designed to be used one handed. If you can wrap your mind around that you will find it amazing. It’s small and thin while the screen is the same size as iPhone 6splus. Love the phone!,5
att.com,iphone,"It does what it’s supposed to do, have dropped it several times with no breakage so it’s sturdy. Lack of the home button and headphone jack take a bit to get used to. Overall good product.",4

att.com,iphone,My older Iphone was acting up something terrible. It is paid off. So I got the X instead of the 8 because of the size basically. Wanted it to foot in my smaller bag. Love the speed.,5

att.com,iphone,iPhone X is a step above the rest in terms of camera and screen! Videos look awesome and wireless charging is super convient! Expensive device but At&t always has awesome promos!,4
att.com,iphone,It took me a little while to get used to no home button But I am swiping like a pro the facial recognition is way better than fingerprint id and the photo quality is unbelievable,5
att.com,iphone,"It’s basically a more badass iPhone than the previous models. You want the latest and greatest, get the iPhone X. Face ID is just one of the many features that I personally love.",5

att.com,iphone,So far i like the phone Do I recommend it to other people yeah so from my mom likes it I just picked the wrong color I want to space gray for the most part it to get phone,5
att.com,iphone,Its an okay upgrade. Wasnt to excited about all they say it can do. You gotta load all the PAID apps to allow most of its features to operate. NOT WORTH THE $$$$$$ spent,4
att.com,iphone,I wish the phone came as a plus but I like it. Apple has out done themselves once again! Great features & the face ID is pretty cool. And the camera is freaking awesome!!,5
att.com,iphone,I love everything about this phone. The face ID is amazing. I love the swiping gestures that replaced the home button. The display is beautiful as well as the camera.,5
att.com,iphone,I love iPhone but nothing about it screams that it’s worth the money spent. My iPhone6s does the same things except for the little talking emojis and facial recognition.,3
att.com,iphone,I’ve only owned the phone for a week and so far so good. The camera on the phone is a big step up from my 6s and there is a very noticeable improvement in battery life.,5
att.com,iphone,My rating is based mostly on value of purchase. There is nothing really new to justify the price in Apples latest version of this phone. Face scratches easier than ever. The camera is OK. Fine for web work but not yet worthy of printing except under limited conditions. This was really disappointing but it is nice to be able to focus more like a camera. For younger users this concept is probably new but for me it’s way overdue and works ok. I prefer the old button interface. IT WORKED BETTER Apple. (even with the loss of screen). The new interface remains so-so after six months of using it. I’m good with it if it improves touch accuracy. The X is far wonkier when it comes to arranging/erasing apps. Forgone conclusion the phone is extremely slippery but of course who doesn’t use a cover these days. There’s nothing wrong with this phone and it has some great qualities but knowing it’s made by slave labor to huge profits without any major improvements the price is simply ridiculous. I regret buying it and have encouraged my daughters to check out Googles phones. Sd (apple guy and cell phone user since the 80’s. ),3
att.com,iphone,I did the upgrade as a Christmas & Birthday gift to myself. Still learning all of the ins and outs but so loving the new unlock system .... FACE RECOGNITION.... XOXO,5

att.com,iphone,I am an 84 year old and I just love this IPhone X. Best of all is the face recognition and being able to use Apple Pay.,5

att.com,iphone,Great product. Have enjoyed all the additional capabilities the iPhone X has. I recommend this new phone to everyone.,5

att.com,iphone,"The iPhone X is awesome, I really like the new features and he pictures are great. I also like the Face ID feature",5
att.com,iphone,"Having owned several smart phones starting with android. I made the move over to the apple ecosystem several years ago starting with the iPhone 5s and have had a few hand sets 6s and se. I love how everything about iPhone just works. There was no looking for alternative apps or tweaking a setting to get things to function. With this phone I already knew it was great looking, but what I’m amazed at is how great and intuitive it really is. The loss of the home button you would think would limit functionality or find yourself missing the center piece of apples iOS hardware ui. This is not the case I find on my other idevices I try to use the touch only interface of the iPhone X. Tap to wake, swipe up to go home, or swipe on the charm bar to seamlessly switch between apps it’s great. Battery life is stellar especially with the stock all black apple wallpaper, thanks to the new oled display. FaceID works quickly and accurately, and I love that notifications on the lock screen are in private mode until I look at them. Just a great user experience and why I rely on the apple eco system of devices.

att.com,iphone,Love the clear screen and once I got use to the face recognition its a great phone.,5
att.com,iphone,"I got the X bc I liked the idea of a larger screen on a smaller phone, but I wasn’t sure about facial recognition or losing my home button. Well, facial recognition is absolutely awesome! You don’t even realize it’s unlocking PW protected parts of the phone. The home button took a few days to get used to, but now I can jump from open tabs and apps without thinking. Now the bad. Yes the screen is longer, but it loses width, and width is what’s important when big fingers are typing on these keyboards. Even if it were an infinity screen it would help bc while the display is edge to edge, picture display is not. That little bit we lose around the edges would help a lot. Also, why the cut out at the top? Yet another example of a full screen, but not full display. I’ll have this for a year before trading in for whatever is new, which is good bc I’m not too sure of this. When I’m at home I actually still use my 6+ more than my X, not a good sign for a high price “game changer”. I do like the wireless charging, but I could’ve gotten that on an 8+. Great phone for someone who doesn’t need a wide keyboard but IMO the length to width ratio is off, and it looks like apps and webpages are just stretched to fit.",3
att.com,iphone,"Probably one of the best iphones that Apple came out with, a little pricey though.",5

att.com,iphone,iPhone X is pass than iPhone 7 the photos are so clear,5
att.com,iphone,"I was looking forward to this upgrade moving up from the iPhone 7, and so far I’m loving it. The lack of a home button does take a bit of getting used to, but it makes using the phone much more seamless especially for apps that utilize the FaceID biometrics where things will unlock just by looking at your screen. Not to mention FaceID will also detect your face even with sunglasses and a hat on! The camera is also a nice upgrade from the previous model coming second to the Google Pixel 2 in overall DxOMARK rating. I’m no photographer but picture quality is superb as always from my experiences with Apple and comparable Android products alike. The past two phones I’ve owned, I’ve put in cases and applied screen protectors as soon as I took them out of the box. Especially because this phone is a slippery glass sandwich, I recommend getting a glass screen protector to retain the screen’s clarity and provide protection in case of an accident (which is easily replaceable in case it does break). As well as a case for all around durability and there are many options available on the market. Overall, the iPhone X is a wonderful product and a decent upgrade over the previous model, otherwise I just paid my rent’s worth for a glass slab.",5
att.com,iphone,I love the iPhone X so much best iPhone I’ve owned....,5

att.com,iphone,"So, First before i start my review i think its important to understand that reviews are not the end all be all of products and services, but they do provide sort of a glimpse into certain aspects of what to expect and potentially look for. All in all its up to the consumer to decide whats best for them and what they like. With that being said, ny personal opinion on the Iphone x is that its great!! I have been an Iphone user for close to 10 years now and haven't had any issues with any of them as i have not had any issues with my 10. I have had my phone for a week now and am really enjoying it. What i appreciate most about apple products is the simplicity of use. Apple really simplifies everything and it makes for the most seamless experience when it comes to their devices. Does it always come out with a new feature first? No there are several other devices that have features that apple doesn't have and features that apple has added that have been around for a while i.e. wireless charging and face recognition. Apple gets killed because it doesnt always come out with something first. Thats not a bad thing to not be first all the time. When they do reveal something its again in a more seamless and strategic way they makes it effortless. if you are looking for a quality phone then the iphone is a solid choice.",5
att.com,iphone,"I upgraded from the iPhone 6, which I was more than comfortable holding. I wasn't really ready for a new phone, but my processor was. It was becoming unsafe and unreliable for me to use...it wouldn't perform as quickly as I needed it to, and wouldn't maneuver fluidly from one operation to the next. I could have gone with the iPhone 8; the size and processor are both comparable with the X. In the 8 the camera lacks portrait mode but (for me) gains with finger print recognition. The X was still a better sell. I'm not a huge fan of the face recognition feature, but I'm hopeful that they may bring back finger print recognition along with face recognition in later iPhone models. The X doesn't always recognize my face, and I don't always unlock my phone while looking at it. It forces me to have to pay attention to it in a way that I don't always want to. I do enjoy the swipe away feature to return to the home screen. Most of the other functions remain the same. The new emoji feature is fun. I needed a phone to work seamlessly and my 6 wasn't cutting it. At the time it was smart for me to invest in a phone that was moving in the direction of Apple's future instead of the 8 which is a healthy reminder of its past. If it is important for your phone to move more quickly and you can afford the additional charge to your phone bill for a couple years, then go with the X. By then you'll own the phone and in another year or two after that be ready for the latest iPhone. Cheers!",5
att.com,iphone,"I admit I was worried that I wouldn’t be totally happy with it coming from an IPhone 6S Plus. I really liked the classic home button and the screen size. I previously had an IPhone 6 and it was a tad smaller than I’d wanted & when I upgraded to th me Plus it took a bit to get used to the size which was borderline too big for everyday pocket carry useage.... and so along comes the IPhone X! being in between the two and with the longer screen than the Plus it’s just what I needed! Size wise if I’m being nit picky it would’ve been nice if it was a tad wider, just a tad, I mean maybe 5/32 or 1/8” of an inch wider and it would’ve been absolutely perfect as far as a little better aspect ratio... With that said though I really like the IPhone X! I like the smoothness and speed, while my 6S Plus I had no complaints with, the X feels pretty similar. I haven’t tried them head to head but they’re both seemless for me in every way. The X does boot up noticeably faster which the 6S Plus was pretty darn fast to begin with. Either way no complaints at all there. Back to the home button thing... a day messing around, getting used to the phone & getting familiar with the gestures, I do not miss the home button in the least bit. We grown to enjoy the IPhone for what it is and Apple managed to modernize and maximize the screen size yet keeping it true to the IPhone we grown to love. The face recognition while not perfect is impressive and you have to use it to appreciate it. It is close to as fast as the fingerprint recognition not quite as reliable especially when it’s is dark or under certain lighting conditions and some apps still have to get bugs worked out regarding this but I’m sure that will improve with updates. It does work 90% of the time for me and really impressively fast at that! Little things like the alarm toning down when you look at the phone and just being able to is it with the phone on your desk etc with your hands “tied” up all you need is a free pinky & looking at your phone be able to easily unlock and use the phone. It does make it very convenient at times and you won’t really realize those certain things until you have and use it for a day or two. Just when you think it couldn’t get easier to use with the home button etc Apple improves the useability! While the X rids of the classic iPhone look it is not missed once you get to enjoy the maximum screen size yet keeping the phone more compact. I also have to reiterate it still feels and operates like an IPhone which for me is a huge positive. The battery life impresses me. It is supposed to have less life than that of the Plus models however not the case for me granted my Plus is a couple years old. Either way I am happy with it, I use my phone quite a bit throughout the day and for work as well & I can go the whole day on a full charge whereas previously maybe 2/3 of the day before needing to charge my 6S Plus. Camera and screen display is just wow. Noticeably crispier and More vibrant colors than my 6S Plus. The Notch.... I admit at first it was a bit irritating blocking that small portion of the screen while watching or playing full screen but for me now does not bother me at all & in rare situations where I need to see where the notch is a simple pinch to bring the screen in squares what away. Yes in that situation some say that now you’re no different than the non Plus size iPhones. In that regard while I can sort of understand I don’t agree with that in whole. It’s almost like saying “I have to stay below 70mph on certain roads in my Lambo Diablo so now it’s no better than a Kia” I mean with all the X has to offer, having to deal with occasionally watching a slightly smaller screen than I was used to on the Plus is for me not a prob at all. When I’m able to utilize the entire screen it’s definitely Impressive and do not miss the Plus at all. In fact I’ve grown to really appreciate the more compact size of the phone. Now my old Plus which is now my daughters feels bulky and heavy! That’s not to say I wouldn’t consider an X Plus if that comes out tho haha! I do fee that I’d they end up making the Phone X “plus” the same size as the 6,7,8 Plus it would probably be too big for my taste however slightly smaller than the 8 Plus and we only can imagine the screen size and it will make it a tough decision but right now I am enjoying my IPhone X! Get a good case to protect your investment, there are a lot of cool cases out there for it. It did impress me tho, a friend dropped his (slid off his lap) with no case out of his Jeep on to the pavement! He got lucky! He doesn’t like cases , to each his own... anyways. Two thumbs up for me!!",5
att.com,iphone,"Where do I start? The ten is here and it lives up to its name. The facial recognition feature is a determined leap forward in iPhone security, as surely as the iPhone 5 was with its (then) revolutionary thumb scanner. The elimination of the home button will take some time to adjust to, but adjust you will. The downside of the upswipe to switch from open apps and windows is that to close them becomes a three step process. First the swipe up to view them all, then the depressing of one to prepare some (or all) to close, then finally depressing the red dot close tabs on the corners of the windows. This is at least one step too long, and something I expect the engineers at Apple to rectify in the future. As for the camera, you get what you pay for (in this case, handsomely) from Apple. And, as always, it is nothing short of the current state of the art. The iPhone X has set a new standard in how to deploy pictorial splendor from your pocket. The photos and videos you will record are absolutely breathtaking. This is quite simply the new bar that all other smart phone cameras will be judged by. The portrait mode is in a class by itself. Also included is an updated Clips app that now boasts some augmented reality for your enjoyment. As one would expect, there will come a time when this current incarnation is revealed to be crude and ancient, but for now, it’s quite satisfying. The screen size, is just large enough to take advantage of the superior camera the ten boasts, but still respectful of the constraints of the pockets most of us will be fishing this device in and out from. While the price is extraordinarily steep, it is a worthy successor to Apple’s rich history in setting the standard in smart phones. The X is here. It is a ten.",5
att.com,iphone,"I’ve been an iPhone user since iPhone 3 and have upgraded at least every two years since. Though I was leery due to the exorbitant cost of the iPhone X, I finally caved and bought one 8 days ago. Despite the two hours of frustration learning new hand motions for various features, I grew to love some of the added functionality, speed, and shiny-happy look. But almost as soon as I first held the iPhone X, I was gravely aware of its “slippery-ness”. There is NO REASON whatsoever this phone needed to be designed with a glass front AND back. You cannot place the iPhone X on a couch next to you without it slipping across any type of material and into the cracks between cushions ... if not onto the floor. For that matter, you can barely hold the iPhone X without it slipping out of your hand, thereby guaranteeing sales for an entire eco-system of case makers either at the Apple Store, cell phone outlet, or online ... all add-on costs that should be “elective”, not “required”. Now here I sit ... with a cracked front screen despite a premium Zagg screen protector because I ordered an expensive folio-styled case for my iPhone X and it hadn’t arrived before the first time the phone decided to launch itself out of my grubby little hands. If there were a way to file a class-action lawsuit against Apple for intentional designed-obsolescence ... or worse yet, money-grabbing downstream sales ... I would be the first to stand in line to initiate or join such a cause. Yes, I’m ultra-pist (intentional mis-spelling). Why? Because I promote Apple from here to Sunday with my almighty buck. I own a new iMac, a MacBook Pro, a one-year-old iPad, and I have a drawerful of old iPhones I use as wifi toys around my house. Apple, I’m mad you’ve made me so sad. ;(",3
