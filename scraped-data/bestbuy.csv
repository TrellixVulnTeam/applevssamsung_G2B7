BestBuy,galaxy,"I picked up the phone on release day to see if there was much of the same from previous iterations of the galaxies or if Samsung actually listened to their customers. Well I'm here to tell you they've done a great job.



Pros:

-Screen - The screen is the best in the business. Colors are beautifully saturated with enough brightness in direct sunlight as well as good viewing angles. HDR content looks phenomenal as expected also.

-Design - Although I'm not a fan of glass on glass phones this is still a beautifully designed phone and appreciate the taming of the curved screen in comparison to the S7 and S8.

-Speakers - Wow, the speakers are phenomenal! I prefer front facing speakers like in the Pixel 2 but these are definitely one of the best sounding stereo pair I've heard. At max volume it starts to sound a bit tinny but I don't play my music or movies at max volume anyways.

-Fingerprint Sensor - I'm glad Samsung listened to their customers and changed the placement of the fingerprint sensor. It's far more accurate than last years S8 and the setup was done in no time as well.

-Camera- The camera on the galaxy s9 is an absolute beast. Colors are punchy and detailed and the variable aperture can really shine in low light scenarios. Low light photos outclass the Pixel 2 especially with noise reduction. Selective focus is a bit wonky with edge detection from time to time but still manages to produce great images the majority of the time.



Cons:

-Battery Life - Battery life is probably the worst thing about this phone. I'm a light to medium user and average about 24 hours on a charge. Although the battery is perfectly fine for my usage I can see how a heavy user might not make it throughout the day. I understand Samsung's point of view on being safe with the battery capacity due to the fiasco with the Note 7, but they could have put a greater capacity or optimized the battery better. I've gotten better battery out of my Essential phone which is comparable in screen size and battery capacity. 



Conclusion:



Overall, I think the Samsung Galaxy S9 is a great buy for someone that is looking for a complete package of power and performance. If you're a Samsung fan or need to upgrade from an old phone and want the latest and greatest then it's a no brainer. If you're looking for a near stock android experience with quick updates then this phone isn't for you. I hope this is the year Samsung finally gets their update scheduled worked out to provide customers with fast OS and security patches in a timely fashion.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I have a very annoying obsession with trying new phones wherein I switch between android to iOS phones about once a year. With that said, there are things I like about both operating systems and this is not my first switch between the two. Hence, I recently picked up a new unlocked Galaxy S9 for my latest venture. This phone is sleek, classy and absolutely beautiful. Additionally, it’s very speedy and has very smooth operation. The camera is of very high quality, too. Better than my current iPhone 7 Plus in many respects. 



HOWEVER, I found that the cell and WiFi reception of the S9 was insufficient for my needs and it was subpar to my iPhone using the same nano sim in both phones as well as the same WiFi connections. Granted, where I am located is somewhat spotty at times for cell connection, but it would not pull in the signal as well as the iPhone. In the same exact areas using the same exact SIM card I can consistently get one to two bars of LTE with the iPhone, but the S9 struggled to acquire any type of signal and quite often would fail. The same applied when trying to connect to the AT&T hot spot in my truck. I tested the S9 with both T-Mobile and AT&T and got the same results. 



When you’re in an area with very strong cell coverage you probably won’t have any issues, but when cell coverage is slim you may have serious difficulties. I ended up returning the S9 in the end and eating the $35 restocking fee rather than have a beautiful new phone that I couldn’t use for its basic and primary purpose...data and talking. Had it met those basic needs, I’d give it 5 stars. I wish I could strongly recommend the beautiful S9, but I can’t. Maybe you’ll have better luck.",3
BestBuy,galaxy,"I haven't owned a Samsung device since the Samsung Infuse 4g. Over the years I've jumped between One Plus, Motorola, and the Nexus line. My most recent was the Moto Z play which I owned for a couple years. That coupled with the Moto Mod battery pack, would last 3 days on battery. It was nice, but with the older SD620, it was definitely getting slow. Camera wasn't great at all, and to top it off, the screen shattered on me. I walked into BB looking for a phone, planning on getting the Moto X4, but wasn't so sure about it especially since it is almost 2 years old. I knew the S9 was going to be phased out soon, so I took a peak at that, and noticed it just went on sale for $100 off. I wasn't looking to spend $620 on a phone that day, but I did it.



First, the UI of the phone is nice. It isn't as bad as what I remember hearing about the old TouchWiz. It's not laggy, and easy to use. Bixby home isn't too bad, but the bixby assistant leaves something to be desired. I've downloaded an app to remap the Bixby button (can't be done in the OS), but it has disabled the bixby home. Hopefully this might be something that can be released in a future update, but as far as I know about the track record of Samsung updating the OS I don't expect that to happen ever. 



What was nice to see is Samsung has a similar feature to Motorola's always on display. You can get a quick glance of what your notifications are while your phone is locked, without revealing too much information.



The phone has an IRIS scanner that works great for extra security, though I wish it would require you to blink to be able to unlock it. Even in a very dark room it's easy to unlock. Now the fingerprint sensor, I do wish that it was on the front of the phone rather than the back. I run into situations, often, where my phone is sitting on my desk and I want to unlock it real quick, but the fingerprint sensor on the back requires me to pick the phone up. I know, first world problems, but it would be nice to have.



The battery life isn't too bad. With the phones FHD+ screen, and always on display, I have been able to squeeze a day and a half out of a full charge. This could be better if I didn't have a bunch of applications running in the background.



Now the camera is excellent. I've always had phones with ok cameras. The moto z play had a terribly crap camera. The camera on the S9 compared to the Z Play was a difference of night and day (seriously, low light pictures come out great). The front facing camera is also very good. Excellent for doing video calls.



Definitely a great phone, but not perfect. If it weren't on sale, I probably wouldn't have purchased the S9, but for an extra $100 off, I believe it was worth it.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"To be sincere, I was very skeptical about buying this phone because I had heard a LOT of bad reviews about it. Too many to be honest, so i was between buying this one, the Note 9 or wait for S10 which comes this year. I was even thinking about going for my second favorite brand that is LG.

Furthermore, I gave in and i was hoping I was getting my money's worth, and i can say I did. My S7 was a sharm, i loved my phone so much, It lasted me about two years if I am not mistaken, I was only hoping my S9 was an upgrade and not a downgrade which thankfully it was an upgrade. The screen is slightly taller, and the ohone it is thinner which i do enjoy. I thought i was going to have a problem with not having the home button at the front, but in reality, it doesn't take much getting used to. I also thought I was going to take some getting used to with the fingerprint on the back, but that wasn't a problem either. Love the graphics of the phone and LOVE the battery life most of all! My phone lasts all day and I use my phone frequently. Speakers are great as well, i love that it's pretty loud. No problem with hearing other people either and also no problem with connecting it to my fitbit or any Bluetooth device I own.

I also love the fact that my phone has 64gb internally and I can still add an SD card to my phone.

Phone is super responsive, no problems at all with that and has not frozen on me or rebooted by itself like my S7 started to do (it was old). I definetely recommend this phone.

I don't know to what extent did other people used their phones that they didn't like it or love it for that matter, but i believe it's a great phone. Maybe because I never owned the S8 so I cannot tell the difference. Great phone over all.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Switched from using Iphone's to this. 



Here are just a few things that I don't like:

When you receive a text message you can either have it set to show who the message was from and what the message says or you can have it set to say Text Message, meaning when someone texts you it just shows you that you have a text message. So you don't know who text you. This bugs me very much because on my Iphone when someone texts me, it would say who the message was from. Then I could determine if it was something I should view right away or if it was just a spam message (like from a sale from cherry berry).



The next thing that bugs me is the ringtone, notification tone, media, and system are all separate volume controls, which usually would be nice. However, you would think ringtone would me from a call and text message and it's not it is strictly phone calls. They lumped text messaging into notifications. So now if you want to turn your text message volume up you have to here all your notification tones. I have shut most of them off, but I still like getting notifications from some and there is no way to just turn the volume off on those. So the phone will randomly makes noises if I have the notification volume up and half the time I cannot figure out what the sound is for.



One more thing, when I try to send a video to someone it won't let me because it is to big. I am only trying to send a short little 1 minute video and I believe the biggest I can send is 15 seconds. This is just ridiculous to me. I can't send send a partial of a video without cutting the video down to size loosing the rest of the video completely.



Also the keyboard on this phone really sucks. I know you can change it but, it is set up the same way on the iPhone and it just adds random letters or words or doesn't type the word.



I know it has taken some time getting used to this versus an IPhone but there are just those couple things that almost make me want to switch back.



Overall it is a good phone though.",3
BestBuy,galaxy,"This is my first unlocked smartphone buy in USA. The sales person was real honest and explained me about the product details/offers. I used lyca prepaid sim (lyca uses T-mobile network) and it started working instantly. Data speed is high. Don't know if this phone will work in India, experiment that in the next month during my vacation, hope this will work with the networks in India as well. So far this phone works great. It was 38% when I bought this mobile, the whole night i played around the options and settings (got a little eye pain may be i have to adjust the resolution or contrast) and after 5 hours the mobile started getting little heat, i will continue to monitor the performance of the mobile for the next 14 days.



pros: current phone with almost all options, good camera. Got a freebie of Home monitoring kit, dont know how to use it but will give a try this weekend.. :)

cons: phone is getting heat after 3-hrs. Compare this model with Samsung.com. With samsung online, you could save some 60-70$ bcos there is no tax charged. I should have done this thru Samsung site, I thought I could save some dollars by going with Best Buy Credit Card. But no much difference becos of the Tax. So, unless you get big rewards or discounts, dont go for Best Buy credit cards, thats waste of time and one additional unnecessary hard credit check. 5% reward back, 25% accessory/other bundle offers...STILL the Tax amount you have to pay to BestBuy will be more than the savings.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I have always had Samsung since the smart phones began. My S7 was damaged and the insurance had expired. After checking the prices, the S9 was only $100 more than the S7. It is all right so far, a lot I need to learn before I can say for sure. There are a few things I do not care for.



I do not like the the home or back buttons on the screen. Nor do I like the way you send a call. No more just finding the name and swiping to the right. I guess I will get use to it. If not I have 30 days to exchange it for another S7. 



The camera was rated high on the reviews, which was one reason I went with the S9. I am not impressed. I can see a small difference in the quality. Maybe once I read and experiment with it, that will change also. Do not care for the way the picture folders are setup, nor being notified when contacts update their pictures. Too personal and I will change that once I figure it out.



Had to make changes to get it to connect to my Sony Android TV. Though the websites said they were not comparable. Started to return it before I researched it. 



The search and download speed is a bit faster, but the upload speed is a bit slower than the S7. I am just getting use to the apps button being replaced with swiping upward. 



And finally this Bixby thing keeps trying to turn itself on, after I disabled it.



I have only had it for a few days so maybe I am speaking to soon. But I will update my review once I decide.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I purchased this phone with high expectations and they have been met.

Though I originally thought to buy it new I ended up going with the open-box excellent option and have NOT been disappointed.

True to their title the phone was in excellent condition and I personally couldn't and still can't find a single bit of damage. It was essentially brand-new; but considerably cheaper.



All that aside the phone runs great and has soo many useful (for me) features in comparison to my previous Samsung, the S5 Active. That thing was long overdue for a replacement and I couldn't have asked for much more out of one at the price.

I wish they would have included the second rear camera on the smaller version as the 9+ was just too big to me; but that isn't a deal breaker.



The camera is Amazing and so is the screen.

With pictures I wish I could take pictures larger than 4:3 without compromising picture quality; but that's a limitation of a 12mp camera I suppose.



And then there is YouTube which like most all video apps or video players won't fill in the entire screen due to most all video today being shot in a 16:9 aspect ratio; whereas i believe this phone has a 18.5:9 ratio.

You can zoom in on YouTube thankfully, however it does cut the image off a bit.

But for MOST videos it's not too bad.



Anyway, they are all minor complaints and again this is still a great phone.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I can not suggest this phone enough. It does more than any pixel I have ever owned. I once hated touchwiz and swore I would never get a samsung phone. They have really changed and I am very impressed with how the phone handles the interface tweaks. Some of the big things I would like to point out.



Battery - 

 I am getting excellent battery life. I have used it on long rides and have been getting 8 to 10 hours of display time. Enough to last me through the day. I don't find myself needing to reach for a charger until it gets very late at night.



-Dex

Dex is greatly underrated. I am a teacher given a 6 year old laptop to use for work. I instead got a monitor and cable. I can do everything from writing in word to grading papers. Grabbing my phone when I leave reduced my amount I had to carry around to just a phone. 



- Samsung tweaks

The tweaks samsung does only add to the experience of the phone. Not only can I ""cast"" my phone screen to my chromecast/android Tv at home, I can with other devices. Granted some of these devices are samsung branded devices. I found my Microsoft wireless display adapter I got for my surface works with my phone. 



Some of the tweaks I don't care much about can be shut off. I didn't care for the edge screens. Without much effort they got shut off. Anything that I don't like can be changed or tweaked. Want to swap the back and app view, no problem. Want to download a theme to change to make them look more ""android"" no problem. Want to change the colors of the notification quick access no problem.



I can go on and on about how much I enjoy this phone. I look forward to getting more notes from samsung.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I'm just going to say it, I absolutely 100% love this phone. I had a Pixel 2, which is a great device, but unfortunately it took a dive and was broken. My girlfriend and I were looking to switch carriers, so I played it extra safe by buying the unlocked version. Since I first powered this phone up I've been in love. It is fast, responsive, the screen is outrageously gorgeous, and it has everything an Android User could need. 



I would say, for first-time Android users it could come with a difficulty curve especially if you're coming from Apple, but it'll just take some time to master the phone. A lot of people take swings at Samsung's ""bloatware"" but I've honestly enjoyed many of the apps they load the phone with. Samsung Internet is great and secure, and if you have to switch into Secret Mode (Their version if incognito) you can set it to require a password or your fingerprint for extra security (and requires you to do it again should you move from that screen). The other apps have been great and helpful: Samsung health, for working out or managing diet, or even their base messenger app, which I believe works pretty well. 



I would say if you've been interested in Samsung or unsure, go check out a preview model at your local BestBuy/Service Provider. It's a great phone and is wonderfully crafted. Great job, Samsung, I believe you have another faithful buyer if you keep up the quality that this phone brings!",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I've had iPhones for years, but not because I prefer apple but because I always liked the app store. Recently I decided apple wants just way too much for their products so I started comparing the specs of the S9 to the iPhone XS. The S9 does almost everything as well if not better than the iPhone XS on paper and the phone is a few hundred dollars less, so it was a win win for me. I was expecting a nice phone when it arrived but it exceeded all of my expectations. Not only is the phone aesthetically pleasing but it also has the nicest screen of any phone I've handled. The part that I was nervous about was the app store, and I can safely say that Google play has just about every single app you can find on the apple app store. Anyone who is looking to switch from apple I honestly recommend the S9 it will blow you away. And I had the opportunity to compare the iPhone XS Max to the Galaxy S9 because a family member bought the iPhone at the same time I bought this Galaxy S9. Everybody has an opinion in this world but I honestly like the S9 way more now that I've had a few weeks to compare the two. The iPhone XS Max is chunky and the way the camera sticks out is annoying, but the thing that bothered me most is the iPhone has a screen that is not as sharp as the Galaxy and the iPhone screen have a very warm tint which makes everything just look unnatural.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"This review is from Samsung - Galaxy S9 64GB (Unlocked) - Midnight Black

This phone is the best smartphone on the market. It's faster at processing commands than the iPhone 8,x,xs,x max etc. 

 Its wifi and cellular reception are much stronger than iPhone. For example my iPhone ALWAYS drops my home wifi signal everytime I step outside of my house and frequently drops wifi signal inside my house when I'm upstairs in my bedroom and my wifi router is downstairs. 

 The iPhone also instantly loses my cellular data reception everytime I go inside of any Walmart. 

 The galaxy s9 never loses my wifi or cellular signal. 

 Also the apps on the galaxy s9 perform much better than they do on iPhone. The apps on iPhone frequently crash daily. They dont crash on my galaxy. 

 HOWEVER iPhone is better in one task: sending and receiving videos recorded with the device are very clear but are very blurry while using the galaxy s9. That's the ONLY flaw on the galaxy. 

 Still overall best phone ever. 

I'm an honest unbiased reviewer who's review is based purely on long term daily use of both phones.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I just changed from iphone, I like many new features this mobile have, like the awesome pictures, the great way Bixby works, she can understand and do very complex tasks, nothing compared with Siri, I also like that you can see to apps at the same time, the screen is nice.

I love the sound and the volume it reaches. 

Face recognition works well and also Samsung pay, 

Another thing I like are the fact you can personalize features, like stickers for the calendar, the alarm sounds and that it can tell you the time, the calculator also converts measures, the edge panel is very convenient. 

They also have remote assistance so they can connect to your phone and give remote support, which works great.

What I dont like is that some times you need to do extra steps to finish a task, like pressing ok one more time, and also I have experienced something strange we are still trying to figure out, which is I`m receiving randomly happy face messages like this "" :) "" and also that there was a failure sending USSD , they haven´t being able to fix it neither have I.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I picked this up (unlocked) after my Pixel XL died and this is a really nice phone. I was always someone who had to have the latest version of Android and now that is not a huge deal. Touchwize is not as bad as it was from what I remember. If you don't like the look, there are some really nice themes that you can use to change the look and feel. The camera is amazing and the slot motion is really cool. Having a headset jack and SD slot are still great things 

to have in my opinion. The battery on this phone is ok, not great and my biggest gripe/ learning curve is the button placement. I'm not sure why Samsung does it, but the back and app list/view locations locations are flipped. That's not a deal breaker, just something I have to get used to. So far I'm really happy with this phone. If you can, buy it unlocked so you can use it on any carrier, are not tied to a contract and if you are on Verizon won't have all of that bloatware that was just announced to be coming.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I took advantage of Best Buy's Black Friday week sale and got a great price on this phone. I could have purchased two of these phones for one of Apple's flagship devices. Why people buy Apple products, I will never understand.



Anyway, I am very satisfied overall. The phone's battery seems to drain a bit quickly if using Skype video calling or using YouTube, for example, but perhaps that is standard nowadays. If doing less resource intensive task such as web surfing or standby mode, the battery seems ok.



My one major complaint is that I had to sideload ATT's video voice mail. In other words, I had to override the security protocols and download the app from someplace besides the Google's Play Store. I installed Norton's Antivirus (for free since I am an Xfinity customer) just to be safe. All seems okay as far as I can tell, but I wouldn't recommend doing this type of thing in general,. Unfortunately, Google Play does not offer the app that I wanted for unlocked phones.",4

BestBuy,galaxy,"The S9 meets what I was expecting it to do. I upgraded from an S7 to the 9. I considered waiting for the 10, but bestbuy was offering a great deal and so I decided to take it rather than pay more. Complaints about the fingerprint sensor were a major detractor in online consumer reviews. I got used to it before the end of the night. It doesn't bother me at all. Obviously the phone is faster and the display isbeautiful. I love the larger screen due to screen to body ratio. I bought in store. I used a deal I found online on bestbuy. The bestbuy rep didn't know about it, but he looked it up and they honored the deal. He knew what he was doing and it took longer than I thought but we finished and the final cost was within about $2-3 of what I projected between the discounts, taxes, and verizon activation fee. I don't use bestbuy enough these days because I don't have one close enough, but I remember why I used to love shopping in store.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Overall this phone seems like a noticable improvement over my galaxy s5 active. However, the unlocked version does not work with the service provider features. I have AT&T and so far have found the voicemail app, wifi calling, and push to talk app not compatible. I literally wasted 7 hours with At&t phone tech support, and went to the store to get help. Finally a tech support agent told me the unlocked phones don't work with everything. Additionally, the S9 bought as the At&t $800 version is not compatible with push to talk yet. I even went to the verison store to see if features would work if I switched service providers. They have the same issues with unlocked phones. It is a good concept to buy unlocked, but, clearly the providers want you to buy their overpriced versions of the same phone. 



I gave this phone 1 star because the camera is nice, and battery seems to last long. Other than that for basic use, there was not much point in upgrading.",1
BestBuy,galaxy,"I bought 2 Samsung Galaxy S9 back in March from Samsung.com. 

My first issue was when they charged me for my exchanged S7 device that they claimed had physical damage but from the pictures they provided showed nothing more than normal wear. Calling and calling did no good to get anything done and just run around in circles. They couldn't even provide the IMEI of the returned device to prove it was even the one that I sent to them. 

I went to sell my Samsung Galaxy S9 because I was so mad from this experience. I sold the phones that should have been unlocked since I paid full price for the phones. But the phones were locked to T-Mobile and T-Mobile couldn't unlock them. I called Samsung and they couldn't unlock the phones either sending me in circles. I asked the reps why they would send me a phone I paid full price for locked and why they wouldn't unlock the phone. 

Samsung has the worst customer service and I highly recommend getting a Google Pixel or another Android device.",1
BestBuy,galaxy,"There isn't much of a difference between my S7 and my S9. There are features on the camera that allow me to do different things but not to the point where I would waste money on it again if I had to choose to wait for the S10. I purchased the S9 because my S7 had horrible battery life and the operating system was so slow. The phone is much lighter and smaller than the S7. The unlock feature with my face is an interesting feature because there are times when I want to just check the time and my phone unlocks without me wanting it to. Also,the biometrics are on the back of the phone unlike the S7 where it was the home key, so that took a little bit getting used too. Again I stress that the camera isn't a significant upgrade from the S7, you could tell there was improvement but I again would wait for the S10 to come out. The Bixby button on the side is useful,I don't use it for much, it isn't as useful as one would think but the bottom doesn't get in the way.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,Galaxy S9 is very similar to my old galaxy S8 with a few improvements. Easy to upgrade from galaxy S8 with the Samsung Sync and their cable. Just make sure on many apps you login and save your status because not all your data will be moved over unless it's saved in the apps account.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Don't let the outside fool you into thinking that nothing has changed. The S9 is incredible. Loaded with power, efficiencies and features, it will take your breath away! Nearly everything about it can be customized to match your taste and how you want to work and play. The S9 is the new standard for mobile.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I had an S7 and had to upgrade due to it not charging, staying charged or the cords wanting to stay in. I had no choice but to buy the unlocked phone outright, but it's been great so far. I love the facial recognition option to unlock the phone. Phone's battery is great so far. I really like it.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I really like the phone, the camera is amazing, all the features. The screen resolution is great. The only problem with this phone is the battery. Drains too fast, I seriously don't understand, why one of Samsung's best signature series phone would have a battery life this short.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I have owned other Samsung phones starting with the SIII and liked them all, but I love the S9 phone! It's the best phone I have ever owned. All the features are great, especially the curved screen, and the camera is fantastic. It's larger than my S4, S5 or S6, so the dimensions are perfect for viewing texts and videos.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,The Samsung galaxy s9 is a great phone. I got the unlocked version and I love that you can add a micro sd card to expand the 64gb of memory. The only problem is it says I have a voicemail when I don’t but I believe this is a service provider problem rather than a phone problem.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I bought an unlocked version due to Best Buy not having any AT&T models in stock, they told me all features would work. Not all features from AT&T will work on the unlocked model, like wifi calling or visual voice mail. Stick with an AT&T phone if you want all features to work.",2
BestBuy,galaxy,"The Samsung Galaxy S9 really has been fairly easy for me to learn to use, and takes such great pics!

And the gal at Best Buy was So patient and helpful explaining things to me.

We chose to protect it with a ZAGG Invisible Shield and an Otter box.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"Expandable storage, beautiful 4k display, headphone jack, full customization. If you are thinking of getting this phone, stop thinking and get it. The only negative about this phone is the battery life, but with the fast charging and optimizable battery usage, it's not a problem. Do your self a favor and get this phone.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"First I wanted a cell phone with a super camera and I made the right pick, the pictures and videos the S9 takes are really nice. Next I wanted one that looks good, and once again I made the right choice. The Lilac Purple looks so nice. Feels good when holding it too, just the right size for me.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I upgraded from a Samsung Note 3. I considered the S9+ but really like the size of this phone. It's actually narrower than my old phone. It's a major upgrade from my old phone. The battery life is amazing. The only thing I don't like is that Samsung's voice to text seems less accurate than my old phone.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I love my Samsung Galaxy S9. It is easy to use and was very easy to transfer files from my old phone to this one. At first I thought I should have bought the S9+ because the phone felt small in my hand, but once I got a case for it it feels fine. I highly recommend this phone.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I switched from Apple to this Samsung S9 worried that it wouldn’t match up to the iPhone X however it has and then some! I had no idea that Samsung was producing such magnificent screens and the form factor fits perfectly in the hand with a sleek and ergonomical touch. Try it out, you’ll be extremely impressed!",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Great phone, easy to transfer all my files, pictures, vids apps and log ins automatically. The only issue was the Sim card from my S5 was a different size, so I had to go to the Verizon Store and get a new one. If you go to the corporate store, they will do it for free.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Easy to navigate, great camera, slim design. Great price, jumped on the Black Friday pricing. Very satisfied with this Samsung Galaxy S9. Highly recommend to anyone looking for an all purpose smartphone.

Liked the unlock version to enable to select a carrier of my choice.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,Bought this phone to take to a prepaid service. No problem activating it. The phone is awesome. Runs all programs flawlessly no lag and the battery life is great. Lasts all day with heavy use and Samsung fast charging is second to none. Highly recommended.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"My Edge was 2 years old and getting slow. I decided to upgrade and am happy I did. The new phone works great, data and preferences transferred easily, and it's easier to use than the Edge because holding it from the edges doesn't accidentally trigger actions.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"We are still learning all of the features of this phone. What we have learned so far is amazing. It could be a little more user friendly. I think you have to search too much for some of the everyday uses. However, overall, we are pretty satisfied with this phone.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"The Samsung Galaxy S9 is the phone you need to satisfy your hunger for quality. Besides the awesome camera, the phone is super thin, light weight, water resistant and Samsung has some awesome apps to make your experience even greater. Worth the price.. Get yours while they'll hot.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Very good this phone. The only concern is about the micro sd, I read online that this phone has some issues related to Micro SD, and my wife lost all pictures after a photo session. The photo quality is very good, but I recommend use internal memory instead of micro SD.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Excellent purchase,........ .. .........

Recomend.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"If you want high quality and good price, you think it",5
BestBuy,galaxy,Great phone overall experience was good Find the phone,5
BestBuy,galaxy,as of my usage its good and a nice product .........,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Great phone, camera is just awesome, cool self emoji",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I bought a new galaxy but they sent me a used one.,3
BestBuy,galaxy,Awesome phone blazing fast with an awesome display.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,It was a birthday present for my son and he love it.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,I love my new Samsung 9. It better than I expected,5
BestBuy,galaxy,prefect and advance phone for 2018 . I am loving it,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Best phone with greatest features ever,Thx Samsung.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"This phone literally lets you do everything that apple restricts on the Iphone. Great camera, long battery life and lots of freedom for customization. This includes 3rd party apps and widgets. I have had this phone for months and don't have a complaint yet.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I have only had the phone for a week. I can hear it ring and hear the people talking to me without having to put on the speaker phone. This camera definitely works better than my previous Samsung phone. I love the fact that i can talk to my phone without having to press a button. So far so good!,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Beautiful display, ridiculous camera, and let's not forget.. NOT APPLE. The last samsung phone I owned was the s7 and needles to say this is better by leaps and bounds. Only thing better than the S9.. is the s9 paired with the new galaxy watch!",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"S9 is very good product for its price. Compared to its compatitor apple's phone, the Face ID vs Iris scanner in S9 is leak. Samsung may need to strengthen that area. But it is realiable, Fast wirelss charging etc.. make its place in market.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,This phone is great bought one for my wife and I. The camera is amazing and so far so good. Att prices for service are a little ridiculous so I am switching back to metro and they are easily unlocked. All in all the phone is great though. Lots of features.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"As a big Samsung fan, the S9 is a great phone! Light, easy to use and set up and the new features (App Edge, AR Emoji, fingerprint scanner), work seamlessly. Battery life is also pretty good (one full charge can last close to two days with medium use). Overall, great phone!",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I upgraded my Galaxy S5 for the S9. Best purchase ever. I was a little sceptical about the curve screen. But nothing that a glass screen protector can not fix. I really enjoy the camara and the 64 GB internal storage it is a way Mich better phone than my galaxy S5.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Upgraded from a Note 4. This phone has a phenomenal camera, and outstanding display. Battery life has been very good, although I don't use the phone extensively during the day. My one complaint is that the touch screen seems to require much more pressure than I would expect.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"Was waiting to purchase a cellphone and found this special holiday price on Best Buy for Samsung galaxy S9. So far, happy with this phone, just hope I don't regret buying it just months before the launch of S10 :(

Wish it came with Android Pie though...",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"If you like Samsung, you'll love this phone. The build quality is excellent and the camera has a few tricks up it's sleeve. If there is one downside to this phone, it as to be the lack of Android updates. This phone still does not have Android Pie.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I've never spent so much on a phone but I took a risk and it was so worth it, the best investment I've ever made. There is nothing bad I can say about this phone. The camera is amazing, the battery last forever, and it is so fast. I am so glad I got this phone!",5
BestBuy,galaxy,Phone screen is perfect fit for me I love the emoji you create and the camera is awesome even in a dark room you can still see clear. Sound is nice can hear the person you're talking to clearly and watching videos is good too.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,Great phone. Much more advanced than any iphone. Any thing you may be 'missing' is easily remedied by downloading a free app. I will say that sending video through the pre installed messenger app changes its quality to crap. That was surprising given the phone has a much more advanced camera.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I bought this phone along with a black one with the large GB 250+ for my husbands birthday. We had old S6's so of course these are much better. Faster, clear camera quality. The best part is the battery life. It last alllll day long even when watching videos online.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"First, It was priced under $600 . So much to learn and it's simple. Pictures/videos are crystal clear. Sound is awesome . I left the I-phone for the Samsung Galaxy 9 and don't regret it. It does more than I wanted and that is why I am still learning.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Missing several key features from previous S5. 

Cons

1. Cannot delay or schedule future text messages or emails. 

2. No voicemail option unless you pay for virtual voicemail through your phone carrier. 



Pros

1. Face Recognition for locking phone is only difference from S8",2
BestBuy,galaxy,"Great phone..I use it for everything..banking, paying bills,hot sports use when I visit my mom . I love it capabilities. I was able to transfer all my music I bought from the I tune store. I bought this phone the week of cyber Monday for 519.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I was with iphone for like 5years and I recently got this Galaxy s9 and to be honest this is the best switch decision I’ve ever made, this s9 has alot of features and great camera, still discovering new things on this phone, I really loved this product and i would recommend to anyone.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"It's fast, simple to use, has an awesome camera, dual speakers and all around limitless. I haven't found anything that i disliked about the phone yet. If there is one thing, it's not being able to customize your text message background anymore, but you can always get an app for that!",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"The phone feels rock solid and performs very well. It was an upgrade from a Galaxy 3 so boy what a difference!! I also have a Note 3 and this phone hits a sweet spot in size for me. So far, all is great and I love it.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I posted a review for my wife's phone shortly after we got it. Now I'm posting a review for my phone after using for a while longer. The phone is very good, but it is not as intuitive as our iPhones were, but all in all it gets the job done.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I bought this to replace my brother's broken S7. He loves the fact it retains ""almost"" the same dimension as his old S7 with its sleek design. I like the fact that it is unlocked so it can be used internationally on other GSM carriers.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I purchased this phone for my daughter since she wanted to upgrade from her old S5 phone. She has been very pleased with the new phone. Both the phone and the ergonomics are excellent. She also saved $200.00 by purchasing it from Best Buy.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I bought this Galaxy s9 after 3 years of usage of galaxy s6. S9 is faster in comparison with my old galaxy ( Obviously).

I have been using thisphine for a month now and I do not have any issues so far. It works great, looks great and camera is also great.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I already have one of these and my sister needed to upgrade. The phone itself is awesome! Just pulled the SIM Card from the old phone, put into the new one, ran the smart switch program and it was set up. She loves it.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I really love this phone. Pictures are amazing, that was one of the reason for buying this phone. I have had this phone for only 1 week and so far so good. This phone can do so much more than the other phone I had. I came from a Samsung galaxy prime. I would buy this phone again",5
BestBuy,galaxy,Seems to be working good so far. Voice calls are a little choppy though. Could be because it is unlocked though. You have to pay the service provider the same amount as everyone else but you dont get the same perks,3
BestBuy,galaxy,"Coming from an iphone 6 to the s9 it's a huge upgrade. The s9 is packed with features n the camera is crisp n clear. The speakers are loud enough for a smart phone, the screen/display is crystal clear. Very easy to customize the phone to ur liking. All in all it's a great phone.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Although a bit pricey, it's safe to say that the Galaxy S9 is not just a touched-up version of S8. The camera does a lot with the single lens. Moving the fingerprint reader below the camera is the right move. It should have been there in the first place.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,I love my new S9 Samsung unlocked phone that I bought at Best Buy. The process was so easy as the guy who helped me was able to get into my wireless account which saved me a trip there. The whole thing took less than an hour. The phone works perfectly and I am very happy!,5
BestBuy,galaxy,Replaced a Galaxy S5 with screen issues. I decided to go with an unlocked version only with the purpose of ditching the carrier bloatware. It still has some manufacturers apps but way beter. Have used Samsung phones since the S4. I have been very pleased with these phones.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,I find the camera feature most fascinating. It gives a very good picture even in low light. N I love bixby. It is very useful when your hand is occupied with other stuff. The battery life is better and there is still room for improvement.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,"Sleek, fast and great Samsung skins. If you don't want a giant phone this is for you. Samsung has a lot to offer like Samsung Pay (you get points using this like free gift cards), photo gallery, etc.



Phone has good weight feeling premium in hand.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Works great.I love the phone. Camera, speakers and processers are all high quality. I have had the phone for months and still learn new features about it all the time. I would absolutely recommend this phone to anyone looking to upgrade.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"No complaints. Fast, great camera, seems sturdy. Much cheaper than Apple.



buying a case for it is a pain. you need to buy he case and glass protector separately. I got an Otto plus the Otter-made glass. Pretty expensive but easy to install.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"This is not much differemt than the S8 but the differences are fairly spectacular,I hav not become totally aware of everything but the camera is much better, Security is easier to us and seem to be better. I love Samsung Galaxies and will neverown other phones.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"So they curve the glass out to get an extra .000002 screen size and result is drop it say goodby. I went 10 years and dropped plenty of phones, never broke a screen. S8+ note 8 and now S9+ 3 broken screens, last samsung for me until they loose the curve",3
BestBuy,galaxy,"Happy with this purchase - the S9 phone is same shape and size as S8, but the camera shape in the back is different. Otherwise, the S9 specs are superior to S8 and I am very pleased with it so far. It works well with T-Mobile",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Expensive, a lot of extraneous apps, some glitches, but a world better than the Pixel it replaced. I am a long time Samsung-phile, but I'm also bitter about having to purchase the phone myself for work use.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I had to hurry and buy this before I went on vaca. I needed an upgrade on my camera and not carry an extra camera around. Really pleased with the phone overall. The battery lasts forever, and it's quick. I use pre-paid AT&T and it transferred easy.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Exceptional performance, and power saving features to extend battery life up to a few days, great quality all around... would recommend for people who need a reliable, yet powerful phone for different things such as games, apps, etc.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"J was an apple fan for years, but swapped to a galaxy last year. Totally love it! The only thing I miss is iTunes, but honestly that's not a huge loss. This phone is more comfortable and has better features. Highly reccomended",5
BestBuy,galaxy,The phone was working fine and I was falling in love with it however after just few days I notice the screan was yellow and it wasn't because the night mode or reading mode or anything like that. I had to returned it. Not recommended,1
BestBuy,galaxy,"The Galaxy phone line is untouchable in my opinion. I won't lease a phone, or pay for monthly insurance because by the time your done paying all those fees, you just buy this unlocked and save a ton of money.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I have only had my S9 for a couple of weeks but so far it works great and as advertised. I have not had any issues to date. Was a breeze to set up and since this is my 3rd Galaxy phone, I have had no issues getting used to it.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"This phone is amazing. It's snappy, the unlocked variant comes with minimal bloatware, and it just performs like the premium phone it is. And for $650, this phone gives you some of the best performance for a not bad price tag. 10/10 would recommend.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I had not had a new phone since 2014!! I was afraid to get a new phone because I am a senior citizen who had gotten comfortable with my OLD phone. I am amazed at how easy this phone was to learn and to use!!,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Not a hardcore phone user, but this phone is seemless in being able to maneuver for phone usage, take pictures, listen to music. I can easily transition from one task to the next which hasn’t been the case with other name brand phones I’ve had.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Its such a great phone, I really have nothing negative to say. The camera is awesome, its super fast, the battery life is also very good. I wouldnt update from a S8 to a S9, but if you are comming from something less new than a S8, you should consider the S9",5
BestBuy,galaxy,This is my first hand-computer after 12 years of flip phones where the most exciting feature is the camera. The features are user-friendly and intuitive. The touch screen with the glass protector is acceptably responsive.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I got the S9 at the Black Friday price. Using Samsung Pay has been very convenient at terminals that don't support NFC. I wish the battery life were a little better, but at the price I got it for, I am very pleased with it.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I love Samsung galaxy S9 phone.This phone is great in many ways. The new camera technology is a huge improvement. The stereo speakers sounds beautiful. . The camera is greatand being able to make your own gif is awesome. Also, the phone itself runs pretty fast.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,Freedom to do to a lot unlike iphone. Iphone still smoother as far as apps is concern. Battery life not as good as the iphone. Better camera and freedom to upgrade your memory and a lot of customization are a plus.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,Purchasedthis model to replace an older phone and could not be happier. Features and connectivity are great. Have had it for a few days and no issues as of yet. Will update if any come up but as of now it gets 5 stars.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"The phone works well for phone, internet, pictures and music. The Bixby app is a bit of a ""pain"" that I do not bother with but overall I am glad that I selected this phone. It replaced an earlier Samsung model that was not working.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Really like the phone and have not had any major problems with it yet. Although if you already have a S8, there's not much difference. In the end I think it is the apps that you use that makes the device more useful.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I was always an Android user and always loved it but this phone would freeze often. I decided to go to apple. Sadly I don’t think I’ll ever go back to Android. I don’t think it’s too much the phone just personal preference.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,I purchased this for a trip to Bali where I knew I would be taking many pictures. I asked a guy who repairs phones which ones have great cameras. He recommended the S9. It takes amazing photos! Excellent battery life too.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"This is a great phone. All the power, slim and not bulky design, latest and greatest hardware. Only complaint on this is button locations. The bixby button being directly opposite the power/standby button is a poor design choice.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,Appreciate the hand held size of phone. The battery life does last all day. Camera is my favorite feature. Auto focus captures each moment without missing a beat. Pictures are clear and colorful.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,I love this phone. You can personalize it which is my favorite thing about samsung. The camera is really nice quality. The phone is comfortable to hold and I love the convenience the edge feature offers.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Couldn't be happier with the S9, my last phone was an S7. Had my S7 for a number of years no issues with it just getting kind of old so upgraded to the S9 have only hadn't for a few weeks but no complaints.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"The battery life is good, last all day with a lot of use. Pictures are good. Screen resolution is good. Processing speed seems good. Haven't had it but a couple of weeks, but I'm hopeful it will stand the test of time.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I got this to upgrade from my s7. I like that it does not have a separate physical buttin on the screen. 

I like that it has the swipe feature for accessing apps commonly used. 

It did not come with a ton of additional unnecessary apps.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I needed to replace my S3 (so yes, any upgrade would have been an improvement). However, I am quite pleased with features like the Apps Edge for my favorite apps and will soon setup a people edge. Also, the battery life is wonderful.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Finally upgraded from a phone I've had for the past 3-4 years. I made the switch from an iPhone and I love it. I thought it would be a hard transition, but it wasnt. Awesome camera and features. Pictures come out great.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,In the past I've gone back and forth between Galaxy and iPhone and after seeing the camera features on this phone I'm sticking to Galaxy. Much more user friendly and I love having the ability to personalize the phone more compared to iPhone.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"This item was purchased 3 weeks ago. It stopped working within 14 days. Due to the fact that my husband works in Susanville and was unable to bring it to BB, they refused to help or stand behind their sale",1
BestBuy,galaxy,Bought this phone on black friday at the store. Store didn't have colors to choose from but I didn't mind at all. The phone was exactly what I was looking for. My favorite is the camera. It takes great pictures.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"One of the things that matters most to me when buying a high range is the duration of the battery. With this phone I spend all day without recharging using Wi-Fi or mobile data, as well as location and synchronization. I love the duration of the load",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I am very excited to use my new phone. It was delivered earlier than stated. Unfortunately, Best Buy was unable to transfer my information stored on my phone and I had to go to an ATT vendor to have this completed.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I prefer Samsung products because I feel they're more resonably priced and off way more than apple. I love the color of the phone and the screen quality is amazing. Battery life lasts all day!,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"This phone is really slick! It has a lot of great features, but my favorite is that the battery lasts me almost two days with light/medium use! My old phone was making it about 7 hours... This was a great upgrade!",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I have a iPhone X but still decided to try out the Galaxy 9 and I have to tell you there is no comparison between the camera on the iPhone vs the Galaxy 9. If you take as many pictures as I do you will love this phone.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,Purchased as a gift for my wife. Good memory included for apps and pictures. Tactile feel is very smooth including screen side to side. Samsung use similar to previous phone. Was on sale too! Would recommend as a buy.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Sleek design, nice phone, great camera and speakers. I wish it came with the same features my old S6 ACTIVE phone came with and I'd feel better about it. Worry about my ""active"" lifestyle causing issues.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I really love this phone. The screen is bright and clear and the camera features will help you take great pictures every time. It features really fast processor performance, battery life and also fast charging.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Easy to setup and transfer all info off old phone. Great features, beautiful screen, great speakers, and great camera. Battery life could be better but that is typical with all the software that runs on Samsung devices",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I got this phone as a present for my son. I have seen the multiple great reviews so I am reviewing it prior to opening the box on xmas. If it does not meet expectations I will come back and edit this review.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,"Ultra light, love the gold-colored sleek type phone - very trendy. There are so many feature to discover and it amazes me every time i discover something new that I can do with it. Truly, the possibilities are endless.....",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Sam S9 was a good choice! As the S8, body construction, hardware and borderless/edge display are very good. The display is a particular feature that I liked.

The negative point, in my opinion,is the battery. Some times the discharge is too fast.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I like the new phone but I have found that it is not as fast as my S8+, especially on Facebook. Some pages take much longer to load, if they load at all, with the S9. This happens even on wifi so I know it's not a connection issue.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"This is my first flagship device from Samsung .



Everything about the device is impressive- the crisp display, the amazing camera and the excellent processing power !



Highly recommended to all the Android geeks",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Samsung S9 is a great phone , it has one of the best camera , it has a great processor and fast in use Bixby ML quality is good and works fantastic for my Microsoft one drive sync with office work - overall a great purchas",5
BestBuy,galaxy,Phone works great. Cost $2.50 to get SIM card from Sprint to activate phone. Unlocked phone allows me the option to migrate to another carrier or not have to extend a contract to pick up a carrier phone.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"S9 is wicked advanced compared to the other phones on the market like the iPhone and Google Pixels. It can compare to the S9plus and Note 9, and it delivers if you're looking for something at a lower price.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,Only reason has 4 starts cuz the u lock phones u cant video chat with att and it wont do the pie update and pi k up the 5 g for att for some reason only the locked ones on att will do that,4
BestBuy,galaxy,I wish i knew someone that had this phone. Its not for me. Its doesnt give you enough time before it goes into sleep mode. Too many press or click just to get to the main menu. Its not a play friendly phone in my opinion,3
BestBuy,galaxy,I recently upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy as 9 from the Samsung Galaxy S7. I believe the Samsung S7 is a much better product and easier to use I'm not really thrilled with the new model,3
BestBuy,galaxy,"This phone is phenomenal and has everything I want in a phone. Has 64 GB internal memory, but add an micro SD card and you'll have more than enough memory to store photos, apps, videos, etc. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,The phone is nice with great sound quality and screen clarity. I bought the unlocked version and had trouble finding the correct sim card at Best Buy (3 tries) I had to go to Sprint to get it working correctly.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,Switched from iPhone 6S Plus and this phone is great. I would rather use iPhones because I have four years but I am really loving the layout and the speed. And the price is better than the iPhone. I recommended this product.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,I'm happy with phone. A little upset with salesman. He promised me he transferred everything and of course he didn't. He did not take time to help me or show anything. Learning on my own..,4
BestBuy,galaxy,I bought this phone for my wife as a gift on her birthday and she is likes it very much. Camera is great for shooting in day or in low light. She loves to take pictures of our 3 years old daughter...,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I'm so glad I purchased the Samsung Galaxay S9, great upgrade considering I still owned the S4. I love my new phone I can't believe I was missing out. The features are amazing, I can't believe I was missing out. Get it you won't regret it.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,The pictures it takes are breathe taking. Had a little issue with the screen protector not sticking right. It affected the camera syncing but the geek squad guys were more than happy to fix that for me.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Great all around. Good amount of space for you essential apps, music, etc. Nice sleek design. As with any new,definitely have to get a screen protector and case immediately. Overall pretty good so far.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I purchased this phone for work and let me say this phone is way beyond a work phone this phone is probably the best phone I've ever owned to date from the camera to the speaker quality,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S6 to this new S9 and I love it. I haven't had an opportunity to try out all of the camera features, but the pictures turn out great. The touch screen is so responsive and the screen display is beautiful.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Bought this as an upgrade to a Gen 1 Pixel that had lost battery life. Have used it for a week. The positives:



* Good battery life

* Crisp screen

* Excellent camera



Cons:



* Samsung bloatware

* Curved edge to screen",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I have only had this phone for a couple of weeks, but, so far, so good. I had an older Galaxy before this, so I was used to Android, but the operating system is very intuitive in my opinion. I would definitely recommend this phone.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"It's a Samsung flagship, you can't go wrong with it. Display quality and performance are amazing. A nice piece if you're already into Samsung ecosystem: watches, smart home, appliances, VR, etc.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I previously bought LGs phone cheat but poor quality. One of them died after not even 6 months in use. Other one couldn't connect to car. I decided to invest a more money in phone. Paid of. Really great phone...no problems so far.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I am very satisfied with my new Samsung S9 phone. There are still some things that I haven't figured out yet, but it shouldn't be too difficult to do. And I got a really good deal on it.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Still figuring out the new phone :) One glitch, the Samsung keyboard has issues with talk-text. I had to switch it to Google keyboard. For the price of the phone that is a little irritating!!!",4
BestBuy,galaxy,Go back to Samsung 5 quality. Cheap looking and do not like curved screen. Phone is slick and easy to drop. Getting more like Apple. Hate that cause I don't want an Apple phone.,3
BestBuy,galaxy,I love this phone. Bought as a open box for cheaper and it was completely new no scratches or any thing. The phone its self is an awesome phone. I changed my Apple phone and I dont regret it!,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I was in need of an upgrade and boy did this meet all of my expectations. It’s beautiful, fast, and feels really good. The camera takes awesome photos and video and the cool edge to edge screen is a huge plus. Loving my Galaxy 9",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Switched over from IPHONE, NEVER LOOKING BACK. The phone is excellent what researching the internet claims it is. My wife loves the phone and says its one of the best Christmas gifts ever.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I replaced a S7 with this S9. Many functions remain the same. Face recognition fails more than not, so I am back to S7 function.

There are various improvements to make the transition worthwhile",4
BestBuy,galaxy,I switched from LG GYM to Samsung S9 and this phone is fantastic. I was skeptical about Samsung phones but after 2 months of use this is still an awesome phone.. super fast and convenient features.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Pros: Great camera( awesome pics in night mode), fast, display is beautiful, Fingerprint Sensor works flawlessly, design

Cons: little heavier compared to previous s6 edge, charging port has changed to usb C",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"The display is amazing and the phone is also awesome. However, I've only been using it for oh-so-long. Im sure it will wear over time and there might be some differences. Its awesome so far tho !!",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"Finally upgraded from the S5 period of course it's much faster and I love the camera. My only complaints are that It has a new proprietary charger plug in, but also has available wireless charging",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I upgraded from the samsung s6 and it was definetly worth it. It was a slight bummer samsung went away from the micro usb charger and they now have a new charger connection.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,Does everything I need for a smart phone. Great display and sound. Remains fast and seems more reliable than any prior cellphone owned. Continuing to learn more about what this device can do.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,I've had my phone for a month now. Great picture quality and features. It quickly charges and has great battery life. It fits well in my hand and in my pocket. I would definitely recommend it.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Awesome phone...this is my new phone in 4 years...this is like finding water in the desert...the clarity...the function...talk about the speed. Alas, this phone is the ...best...thing...EVER!!",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Love the S9, it fits my hand well the screen is fantastic the UI has already updated to One UI its incredibly smooth and fast, I can see I will be using this phone a lot.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,With the unlocked phone you can take it to any provider that accepts unlocked phones. I love the phone but hate the terrible typing. It adds letters you don't want. Have to type real slow.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I have never seen better pictures than the ones taken with this phone. Outdoors, indoors, dim lighting, they all turned out great. Videos turned out looking like they taken by a professional. The phone quality is amazing.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,Amazing phone with a fancy camera and even fancier design. Took some getting used to but like the rear fingerprint sensor versus the front facing one on s7. Will definitely continue using samsung phones!,4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I chose this over the iPhone x. It has a better camera, it's got a wrap screen (so you can see messages arriving even when it's face down) and it costs hundreds of dollars less. I've had it for about 6 weeks now and I love it!",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"As an iPhoneX owner, I am shocked how much I like this Android mobile. I bought it for my elderly Uncle, and set it up for him. Impressed with the features and ease of use. Samsung did a great job with the hardware!",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Purchased an open box phone, was in great condition for a great price. Aside from that the insurance from the store still covered the open box item for any technical damage.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I love this phone! I switched from iPhone because I was just bored with the simplicity. Samsung has so much more to offer and I definitely recommend to anyone who is thinking about switching. Best decision made by far.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"So far so good, easy to set up and it activated itself with my SIM and it is a very cool color. It seems to load fast. I do not know the battery life for me yet, but I am liking it as of now.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I love everything about my new unlock S9. Best decision I made. Most of all the sleek design and simplicity of use is key. Will be buying 2 more for my son and daughter. I'm waiting for the next sale.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Dont waste your money on this over priced phone. It freezes frequently and the curved edge is absolutely horrible. It prevents you from being able to read many things, which is extremely frustrating.",2
BestBuy,galaxy,"Bought it open package in excellent condition, it said that it would come with all the accessories but its missing the headphones, the pin to open the SIM card and all! Apart from this, phone is excellent!",3
BestBuy,galaxy,"This phone is a big improvement in use and picture quality. I did have one slight issue in transferring my photos, but got it done with a little help from Best Buy Phone salesperson.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"It is impressive, fast, great camera, awesome features, the definition of the screen is amazing too. I bouhht the small size and maybe not big enough to enjoy all the greatness of the screen.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,A lot if new features (we upgraded from a Galaxy S5). The camera has been updated and the pics come out fantastic! We will be taking a class at Best Buy to find out all the new things to do. Its not just a cellphone anymore!,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I had to hurry and buy this before I went on vaca. I needed an upgrade on my camera and not carry an extra camera around. Really pleased with the phone overall. The battery lasts forever, and it's quick.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"My wife had the S5 and was breaking down so it was time to upgrade. Everything is fast and the picture quality is really good. Lots of great features that are available, but still learning how to use them.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I really enjoy using this phone because it has great camera view and emoji of yourself. The only thing is that the battery doesn't last that long. But overall it's a great phone.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"My son previously owned the S7 and always raved about it. For his birthday, earlier this month, the S9 went on sale. I not only bought this phone for him I picked one up for myself. Highly recommended..",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Great speakers for use with streaming books and audio, very nice display for photos. Great connectivity with USB for downloading files, and with 3.5 mm jack for connecting to speakers.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I was with Samsung for a long time than I went to iPhone x my first time within a year having trouble then switched back to Samsung this phone is very simple to use,5
BestBuy,galaxy,So the sun was so hot that my phone was completely blocked out after. Ring outside 20 minutes and have it in my pocket. I love the phone and the size. I wanted the plus but was too big for the type of work I do.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I upgraded to the S9 from my galaxy s7 and it was well worth it. The display is amazing and with the polished new software, the phone is responsive and smooth as can be",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I love this blue color.It has big screen but easy to hold and carry in jeans pocket. It's light weight. Enjoying wirelss fast charging feature. Very happy and satisfied with the purchse.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Just so much value. I do miss thumbprint unlock on front. Ill live. 



Best thing i like one hand usable. Self expandable memory. Headphone jack. Screen share on tv. Ok thing(s) i guess.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,Upgraded because my phone screen was cracked and it was just time. Not into being super updated on tech as I had the S7. But the S9 is great and I am discovering new things with it still.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,"Got 2 of these on the Black Friday sale. Great price! Takes great pictures and is easy to use. Never thought I would spend this much on a phone, but I am very happy with my purchase.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I’ve had my Samsung S9 for about a month now and just love it. Had the S6 prior to the S9. The S9 is so much better and user friendly. It also takes magnificent pictures. The first few pictures I took just blew me away.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,Not as intuative as iphone so still adjusting to apps and navigation. Smart switch moved all my contacts over so that was easy transition. Need apps downloaded on mac to sync.,3
BestBuy,galaxy,Its very good lookin and better camera options... but the charger point is different than any other android ph.. so u have carry your own charger all the time.. and a little heavy I feel,4
BestBuy,galaxy,"This is my second Samsung phone after iphone7. Phone is lighter and responsive. It's been a month using s9 and I didn't find any issues.



Faster charging and longer battery life.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I love the size, ease of use, and organization. It didn't copy over all contacts so that is taking time to update, but everything is crisp, clear, and easy to figure out. And the color is perfect!",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"My wife was so happy to upgrade from her old phone on Christmas morning. So far...no issues to report, everything has worked and faster than her old phone. Couldn't be happier.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,We love our Samsung cell phones! Best Buy had the best price over cell phone company so we bought it as an unlocked phone and then took it over to our carrier to activate it for free.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Purchased the unlocked version as a gift to my wife. So far she loves it specially the speed. As long as the wife is happy, I am happy as well. Would hjghly recommend it to anyone.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I upgraded from an iphone 5 with a bad screen to the S9 unlocked--I wish I had upgraded a year ago. Best Buy had the best price--$200 off, couldn't beat it anywhere.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,It's not amazing or groundbreaking in any way but a solid good phone with nice display. I've also dropped it dozens of times in a light case with no damage at all.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"It has good features. Camera is too bright often. Bixby is worst. Price might be little high. The only problem I have is Bixby and camera. I was in need of a phone urgently, so had to go with this.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"This is my second purchase of this phone. It is a great size, works fast but the best is the picture quality. I am so happy with this purchase and I know my grandson will be as well.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,The young man that helped me was very good and helpful getting my phone set up. Even when I changed my mind about the case for my new phone he didn't mind redoing the whole transaction without complaining.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,The S9 is an excellent phone and the battery life is impressive. The size is ok as it fits perfectly in one hand. The fingerprint sensor at the back is great for easy phone access. Excellent phone.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"MSamsung remains the gold standard for smartphones, and their Galaxy S9 is the current flagship of the fleet, with enough features to keep any technophile occupied for months.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Excellent performance in a sleek package. Phone is perfect size in my opinion and feels great in the hand. Improved location of fingerprint sensor, excellent camera and beautiful screen. New 645 processor seems lightning fast and now can disable Bixby in settings to avoid accidental touch. I'm not sure what else you could want in a phone. I use unlocked version on tmobile and works great. Yes wifi calling works perfectly. I traded a pixel 2 and the hardware on Samsung is superior. I like pure android also but Samsung has done a great job on their little unique functions. Excellent lte reception. Buy a nice protective case as phone is beautiful and fragile on both sides. Memory expansion and headphone jack make a very good product better.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"The Phone is Samsung which up till now I thought was ""ahead of the curve"" in features and performance. The Display is Bright and clear. The Camera takes really nice pictures. Thats the upside. The downside is. The battery life is a joke. I mean it isn't adequate. I mean it seems like it runs out of Gas super fast, SUPER FAST. The keyboard is tiny, it is Really really small and very hard to type on. Forget about responsible texting and driving. Even the Smallest message requires 120% concentration and you will get into an accident. And ""Bixby""...BIXBY and that stupid activation key are so annoying the second thing you do with the phone is youtube how to disable Bixby AFTER charging the tiny battery. You would be a fool to not get an extended warrenty because the battery is gonna die a minute after the factory warrenty is up. Samsung, you got me on this. NEVER AGAIN Samsung",2
BestBuy,galaxy,"I had an s7 that was lagging and getting to the end of its line. I had it for 3 years. Im not a android fanboy or apple either. Ive had both phones and enjoy them just as much. The reason I decided to stick with samsung was because I wanted the headphone jack and ability to expand my memory. I dont think the iphone or any phone for that matter is worth 1000. The iphone Xr was also in my books, but with this phone I get a more manageable size 5.8 and get the nice screen. The phone is really fast and handles all my apps. I use it daily and get enough battery to get me through the day. If you are looking for a phone I really recommend this one or the s9 plus if you want something a little bigger. Maybe now wait a little because samsung will announce their new phones next month, meaning these might drop in price.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Although it is not my IDEAL phone (I hope that it eventually will be possible to get a super reliable plain Android phone, like a reliable Pixel) I can recommend this phone to anyone not bothered by Samsung custom software. I do development to some extent so I look for phones that aid me with that. Samsung takes an approach where they go ahead and substantially develop tools and apps for their devices. Example: Bixby is the assistant (think Suri or Cortana). The settings, and user interface (UI) is custom designed by Samsung. That said, the Galaxy S9 is a great phone. The camera is very good, it has micro SD expansion and a headphone jack. The screen is very good. Battery life has not been a problem. The sound output is good l. I do not do gaming but I imagine that the phone would be fine for all but the most demanding games. It has relatively new processors and adequate memory.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I actually bought this about a month ago. And wanted to get some use in before posting any kind of review. The phone I owned before this was a 4+ year old Motorola Droid Turbo. And it was starting to show its age. So yes I was way overdue for a smartphone upgrade. So this phone was my tax refund treat for myself this year and it was worth every penny paid for it. Battery life has been amazing ending the day averaging in the 45-50% area. And this for moderate usage (games, music, web browsing). I haven't had too much time yet to play around yet with the camera yet on this. But if all the reviews are correct I am gonna really like it. So unless you are a diehard fan of the note or are just looking for a good samsung phone. Don't hesitate on pulling the trigger on this phone it is definitely worth it.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I moved to this phone from my Blackberry Priv and the phone is working like a champ except for one thing that is extremely troubling. That is email. In the past when I reviewed my email on the phone, I could delete the email from my phone but still leave it in my server inbox. This phone, no matter how I tried to set it up, does not allow me to do that. Doing it this way allowed me to not clutter my phone with old email but only look at the new email as it came in. Later on when at my computer I could review and reply intelligently instead of using the micro keyboards on the phone. I'll try again some day, but I am not looking so happy about the prospect. Below I had to select whether or not I would recommend and the answer truly is based on what the friend is looking for so don't go hog wild because I said Yes.",3
BestBuy,galaxy,"I think this is one of the best phones I have every had. 

Camera: I am a big fan of the camera because the quality of the pictures is amazing. And that is one of the reasons that I wanted this phone in the beginning.

Speed: the phone runs very well and fast. I dont really know processing and stuff but I've had the phone for a month now and have been running a lot of things at once.

Battery: it is amazing how well the battery holds a charge. I can go the whole night without charging the phone and will still be pretty decent and ready to go in terms of charge for the next day. Battery will last me mostly the entire day with normal use.

Extra: I have a really fun time figuring out the phone things the phone has to offer. The storage space on the phone is really good. Sorry I couldn't add a picture but I'm using the phone to write the review.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Upgraded from a Galaxy S5 Active, and I'm not sure I don't like my old one better. I'm not a big tech-ie so I basically need my phone to just make calls, text, and e-mail. Not a big fan of the curved screen so far either. Makes it somewhat difficult to find a quality case with good screen protection. The extras on the S9 are awesome if you're into that sort of thing such as camera quality, upgraded photo and video features, new emojis and .gifs. The stereo speaker makes the sounds extremely clear and the music is awesome. Wireless charging available. My only real disappointment is the lack of options with text messages. You cannot change background colors or font as with my old S5 Active without installing a separate app, nor can you set individual text tones for contacts. One tone for all. Overall an awesome phone though and I hope I get used to it soon. Would definitely recommend.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"Another great flagship phone from Samsung. I had purchased Samsung S8 last year and bought this one for a family member, this year. A year without an issue with my Samsung S8 encouraged me to get this new version this time. Samsung has really improved the hardware and software in past couple of year. I am looking forward to get One UI from Samsung to be available on this phone soon. So far, a month or two using this phone, I have not heard any complaint from the family member who is using this phone. This phone has all the latest tech that you can find in the competitors (Apple) phone, plus expandable storage, Iris scanner, and more. Highly recommend to someone who want to switch from iPhone and experience the fun of using Android OS.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"After owning this S7 and going straight to the S9, I am glad I skipped the S9. One of newest features I enjoy using on this is the retina scanner to unlock your phone, and even the samsung pass option that will auto-fill your passwords using just the retina scanner. I don't get much use from the finger print reader. The battery life is not much of an improvement on the S7, I'd even say they are nearly the same in terms of use-time. The physical difference between S7 and S9 is nearly identical too, but the S9 will feel and look slimmer because of the edgeless screen. In reality it doesn't take up any less space in your hand or pocket. All in all, it was a good upgrade if you are on a two year phone cycle. Will I skip the Galaxy 10? Probably.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Bought the Samsung Galaxy S9 because my beloved S5 was slowly dying. If you haven't used and S8 or 9, here's a little tutorial regarding saving pictures onto your SD card in separate albums...with the S5, you clicked the 3 dots in upper right corner and the menu dropped to allow select, then move. Not so on the S9. To move pictures, you press ""firmly"" on chosen picture, then you can select others to go with it, then the 3 dots, which will show the move section on menu. Not trying to talk down to any one reading this, I am not that tech savvy and wanted to spare anyone else the frustration. 

Have not tried all of the features yet, but love the pictures the phone takes.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I love my samsung galaxy 9, with all its glory and faults. 1st off, I love how the battery holds its charge throughout the day. I had an iPhone 6 before and it was not able to hold a charge for more than 4 to 5 hours. Also, I got a deal for this phone where Best Buy gave us 128 GB more storage and a wireless charger, in addition to the phone which makes me a very happy mama, since I take so many photos and videos. It is easy to use, awesome camera with ar emoji capabilities, and syncing it with Google is incredible. Some of the features I don't like is how sensitive the screen is and settings/applications can be so easily accessed if you're not careful (read: have curious kids). However, with it being waterproof and all, this is definitely one of the best phones I have ever had and am very happy with my purchase.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"My primary motivation for upgrading this phone were 2: (1) I had a second SIM card for a second line, and needed a phone to put it in, and (2) I've been using the Galaxy S phones since about the S4, not missing an upgrade year, and so far i've been happy with them. To be honest, I do not notice THAT much different than the S8+ besides maybe security/sign-in options, however because Samsung only promises maybe one or two major operating system upgrades per phone model, if you want the latest operating system, it seems you always need to upgrade at some point. Unrelated, but I may trade my old S8+ for an iPhone on my second (older) line as it is possible this will allow me to develop applications targeted and tested to both IOS and Android, which was part of original motivation for getting two SIM cards to begin with.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Phone is about 1 month old. The purchase of this phone was a big upgrade for me. I had a $70 LG prior to this but needed something faster as I was just promoted to a management position.



Pros: Google Maps seems to work faster, so does the text message app. Nice speakers. Charges fast and long battery life.



Cons: Lately when I am doing something, the page or app I am on freezes and I have to hit the back button in order to use the keyboard/continue on the page; this happens several times a day. I have also been noticing the keyboard not fully appearing or disappearing. This phone comes with ""Bixby"", essentially a Siri, but it sucks and cannot understand me or my commands in any simple manner.



Overall recommend.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"Going back to my iPhone. I had a lot of hope for this, but I was disappointed with the facial recognition only working in certain light conditions which made just getting into the phone a cumbersome process, the bluetooth connection to my fitbit and my home lock was weak and delayed and sometimes did not work without reset. Weak bluetooth compared to my iPhone which always just works. The curved screen causes extended case costs. If all a curved screen does is look nice and cost more, that doesn't justify getting a phone with a curved screen! The wireless charging is terrible. The phone has to be out of it's case and placed on the charger just right or it doesn't charge or charges on and off and makes a lot of annoying noise. I got to the point, after only 3 days, I had to take it back.",1
BestBuy,galaxy,"My almost 2 year old 6p was shutting down with 80% battery left and so I was in the market for a new phone already. They're getting more and more expensive and needing to replaced way too quickly now. That said, I'm pretty happy with the new S9. Best Buy had a pretty good deal on an unlocked S9 for $700 that came with a wireless charger and a 128GB SD card. Still expensive, but didn't hurt quite as bad.



The Nexus 6p is a pretty large phone so I was really happy that the S9 is able to have the same screen size as the 6p but the phone is still a lot smaller than the 6p. That was the hardest thing to get used to about the 6p.



Pros:

Wireless Charging

Large screen but still a small phone

Charges quick and battery life is really good so far



Cons:

Price",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"So I just joined the 21st century with this purchase... my first cell phone. I got it to replace a land line that was more expensive than a cell phone. So as a replacement phone, it's great, I'm saving money, it's always with me (great for car emergencies for example#, has an ""answering machine"" built into it, contacts etc... The benefit is the extra work the devices can do. Love having a camera handy #although it is pretty limited in nature compared to the pro level camera equipment) .... I'll need to figure this app thing out and how to make the device less of a ""snitch"" and a sellout of personal info to ""Big Brother."" Overall happy with the purchase and it should last me a few years or hopefully model cycles!",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I bought the S9 because my old android phone died and it needed a phone for work. I really didnt look into the capability nor the specs of the S9, just went to the store, picked it up, and went with it. After 3 weeks of use I can that this is the best phone I have ever had. The battery lasts at least 2 days before I have to charge it, and that is without having the power saving on, and I use my phone heavily. The camera takes amazing pictures and the screen resolution is fantastic. It is water resistant, very fast, super light, and it looks amazing. There are too many functions to list them. I would recommend this phone to a friend.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"The phone itself is great, its fast, fits nice in the hand and in your pocket, the internal storage is large enough to download numerous apps and the phone can hold up to 400gb of external storage. I use a case for it without a screen protector and I've noticed the screen is really susceptible to micro scratches. I've had the phone maybe 3 weeks now and within the first week it had tiny scratches on the screen and I never put the phone on or near anything for it to happen. It's not that noticeable but still, you'd think for the price of the phone the screen would hold up better than that. Overall though I have no real complaints it's exactly what I needed",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I have been using an iPhone and upgraded to an unlocked Samsung Galaxy S9. It has been a frustrating experience:

1) AT&T Visual Voicemail will not work. Apparently I need an AT&T branded S9 to get that. No one informed me before I purchased this unlocked phone.

2) I have chat history in Viber and WhatsApp that I cannot move to Android. For example, Viber on iOS will backup the chat history to iCloud and then Viber on Android will try to restore from Google Drive. Not very smart.

3) The constant ""helpful hints"" in each app, reminders, notifications, buzzing, beeping... it's enough to drive anyone nuts. I just want to get work done.

I would not recommend this mess to anyone. If you have an iPhone, stay with an iPhone. If you're happy with Android, good for you.",1
BestBuy,galaxy,"6 years of iPhone and we decided to go to an andriod system for greater interoperability. I little different process to get use to, but overall very pleased.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,I love it! It works for what i meed. I love the customization and the creek savers. Hands down i easily see myself getting another galaxy down the road.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Bought Samsung S9. It did not disappoint my expectations. Ear phone are more robust which resists wear and tear. The screen is very attractive and resolution is awesome. As always, Camera is the BEST!",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"Had this phone for a month now. Love all the features. It is very user friendly. Love the sleek, light weight design and how it feels in my hand. Takes great photos and videos.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"This is a great phone, it works without any hardware issues holding back speed. I'm just having a really hard time getting used to an Android Phone verses the I-Phones that I have been using for over 10 years.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I just upgraded from A Samsung 6S to Samsumg 9S. It was so easy to transfer my files and apps, and they appeared in the same layout as my old phone. Has made the transition easy.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I recently bought Samsung - Galaxy S9 64GB (Unlocked) - Midnight Black mobile phone and I am really happy with the performance. It works well and the speed and charge is very satisfying.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,I upgraded to this phone from a Galaxy S3. I like everything about it and I especially like the fact that it is unlocked which means that I dont need to be married to a carrier.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,I immediately went to the front facing camera when i got the phone. My last one was the s7 edge. Difference was insane! You can also fit an extra row of icons of the screen,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I just upgraded from the Galaxy S6 to the S9. The battery life is so much better, the quality of the pictures is better...the phone is overall very good.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,Love this phone. I upgraded from an LG V20. Had some problems with background color at first but reboot solved the problem. Lots of customizability and takes great pics,5
BestBuy,galaxy,Upgraded my S6 edge after 2 years. Use of full screen is great especially for watching videos. Low light photos are good. Battery life is probably the one needs to be improved.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,"Samsung S9 is an incredible phone. Solid build quality, superb screen, very long battery life and easy to customize. I charge the phone once in 48-50 hours with decent use.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Don't touch that Apple without trying that Android. Much easier to navigate and play. To justify my review, you need to try it yourself. But you will be amazed.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,The S9 has performed great! The battery life is superb to say the least. I am not constantly using my phone but for example while streaming music for 3-4 hours it only consumes around 10% of the battery.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"The camera is amazing, its takes good pictures in bad lighting conditions and the slowmo function is awesome. You can create your own emoji and the phone’s processor is fast.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,Bought this unlocked as an upgrade for my girlfriend. It replaced a S7. She loves the phone and is still learning the new features. I’m an iPhone aficionado but can navigate this phone with ease.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,Great experiencing this new phone and still learning all of the advantages of owning this phone! Always recommend this phone when someone wants to upgrade!,5
BestBuy,galaxy,Was able to price match with Amazon and I got it for such a good deal! Didn't order off Amazon in time for it to arrive before Christmas so this was such great news.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I replaced my S8 with the S9 and I like the differences, it has the slow motion feature added and the emojis. The videos look really great on the screen.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I had to upgrade my phone coming from the s7 this s9 OS awsome I like the way it looks and feels its something getting used to since the finger print scanner is in the back,5
BestBuy,galaxy,Really enjoy having a phone without all the preloaded software from the carriers. It has a good battery life and is fast either on wifi or mobile data.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"First time Black Friday shopping, and what a deal on a Samsung s9! Best Buy staff were very patient and helpful, even tho it was probably the craziest shopping day- thanks!",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I purchased this phone for my son after his previous one broke. He absolutely loves it. Perfect size. Light weight, even with case. Chatting, music, surfing - it does everything, perfectly!",5

BestBuy,galaxy,Purchased the unlocked phone for our Son as a gift. Picked up a new Sim Card and he was on Verizon network without any issues. Great quality and outstanding speed....,5
BestBuy,galaxy,This is a dream of a lifetime I've always worn it series S cell phone you know Samsung Galaxy and now I have the S9 also have the Samsung watch and tap for this is the best I ever,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Although i think Samsung makes high quality cellphones, the S9 odd format does not help when you are using streetwayfinding apps, fir being as narrow as smaller screen phones",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"Wireless charging, a terrific picture taking capability, and finger print security within an attractive, perfectly sized body have made me a very satisfied customer.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Honestly, this is one of the best phone on the market, and I got it for the best price anybody could asks for. Especially since it's unlocked, you could uses it on any phone carrier.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I moved from a Motorola X4 to the Samsung S9. The Samsung Camera is slightly better. The Motorola Android is more user friendly than the Samsung. For me this is not an upgrade.,3
BestBuy,galaxy,Overall great phone but i find it strange that there is no voicemail icon... thus cannot quickly scroll thru each VM. But all in all the phone battery is long lasting and works well.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,I will never buy another phone if it's not unlocked. Best buy had the best deal for one. Their service was incredibly and made transferring my information over flawless.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,"By far the best phone I have had. The screen has flawless images and this thing is FAST! So long iPhone, stop being so proprietary. After all, it is the customers phone.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"This phone did not disappoint at all. I purchased unlocked so I would not be tied to any carrier. It's great on data usage, sound quality, integration of apps, and the camera Oh My! Love this phone.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I got this at a good price and Samsung was offering 30% cash back so I jumped on it. I have this for myself and it is nice so I decided to get this as a Christmas gift.,5

BestBuy,galaxy,"This is such a incredible phone.You won't regret buying the S9 at all. It has so many awesome features and the camera is absolutely amazing and takes very beautiful,crystal clear photos & videos.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I love the fast processor and good battery life. Bit long for single hand use. The factory software was the best. But the update is still okay.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,Unlocked phone works great. Allows options that a carrier phone will not provide. Cost was competitive with carriers without being tied to a new/extended contract.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,The usable features day to day I'm not saying anything different than the S9+. I bought my husband this S9 I got the S9 Plus and I wish I could just went ahead and saved the $150 difference.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,Purchased galaxy s9. Service was good and priced well below Sprint's full purchase price. Highly recommend checking here before purchasing through carrier.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,It's a Samsung Galaxy so we know it's going to be amazing. Not too thrilled on the price point though buying a last generation phone. Just happy I was able to buy it unlocked.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,I love this sleek phone. It has a lot of cool features however switching from and apple to a Samsung just didn’t work. I had to go back to an apple.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"S9 no doubt a great phone comes with great features , excellent camera Quality , sound , display , but i noticed battery life in not that great with performance mode .",4
BestBuy,galaxy,Great phone!!! I had preordered through Samsung website but wouldn't get it till a month later... Best Buy had in stock and a bit cheaper! Love the camera does everything I expect it to do!,5
BestBuy,galaxy,I love my Samsung Galaxy 9 Android phone. The new Bixby works better than Siri and love the new features in the Camera mode. Does everything I need and expected.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,This is a good phone with all the new latest technology.Its camera is super. Everything on it is super unless the battery long lasting that should be improved.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,I absolutely love this phone! I upgraded from the Galaxy S6 and I'm glad I did. This phone has so many features that my S6 didn't have like iris scanning and Bixby.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Battery life is good

It is similar in functionality to the s8 and was able to hit the ground running. 

Camera takes high quality pictures.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"This was an upgrade from a dying S6. The phone performs very well, does as planned. I have had no issues in about 3 months. Excellent battery life",5
BestBuy,galaxy,It has been several years since I had a new phone and the upgrade was amazing. Everything from my old phone moved easily with the prompts and I am back in business!,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Samsung didn't make huge updates on this phone, but I used to have S6, and I notice the difference. Its fast, smarter, has a good grip, and the camera is amazing",5

BestBuy,galaxy,Purchase the S9 Samsung for the quality of the fotos,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I bought this phone for a family member during the Black Friday sale. It was an upgrade from a Note 5. The phone comes with a cable that allows all the data from a previous Samsung phone to be transferred to the new phone. It worked like a charm. All the contacts, photos, and videos transferred smoothly. So far, no problem was encountered with the phone.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,Getting this phone was so easy! All I did was change my sim card over and then use smart switch and it was like I had my old phone back but with a lot of upgrades. I didn't have to spend two weeks being frustrated learning how to use a new phone. It was user friendly and had well-timed and helpful tutorials to help me learn about the latest features.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I absolutely love my new phone, have had service on it for a week now and have had zero problems. I bought the unlocked version to connect to Straight talk and had no issues there. The camera is really nice and the curved screen is really cool but does take alittle time to get used to. Overall I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone :)",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I love Sansung products. I am still learning how to use this phone the S9. So far it's been great using it. It has some great features on it. Bixby, facial recognition, hand signals for selfies etc. I'm excited to learn all the features. The only reason it did not get 5 stars is because I have not used all the features yet.",4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I bought this on the Black Friday deal that got me $200 off on the original price. Samsung is actually doing a great job with improving their phones. If you are the person who likes to be up-to-date with the lastest technologies, start with this phone. It's a great phone to have. Just don't drop it. I recommend a good drop proof case with this.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"We bought this phone on Black Friday. Good price and the phone is working great. Only thing you should know is an unlocked phone does not give you all the features that ""branded"" phones give you. An example: a T-Mobile phone gives T-mobile customers the ability to video talk with other T-Mobile phones. Unlocked phones do not have this feature.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"This phone has one of the best cameras I've seen in a smartphone. It has been an easy transition up from my S5. It's been fun to experiment with and I haven't had to ask for any help yet. My only negative is having no changing weather pictures on the home screen. Also my ring tone did not transfer over, but that is minor.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,The phone has an awesome look and feels great in the hand. The display when set to the highest settings its beautiful especially with 4k videos playing! The camera is better than most! Only complaint is but this might be my fault is the infinity display although beautiful since it curves I accidentally push things when holding the phone,4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I got this phone because of the amazing camera. It is slightly smaller than the S9+, so it fits in my pocket better. The main (and enormous drawback) is that it is Android and so its security totally sucks. Of course Google is tracking every keystroke so that ads are on websites that are tailored towards the user. I hate ""big brother""!",4
BestBuy,galaxy,Been a while since I started using my S9 and have been really happy with my S9. Upgraded from iphone as the new ones got real costly and no regrets. It's a great phone. Fast and the camera is really cool. And the best I can just add a real in expensive Memory card and get tons of memory. All in all much staisfied with my decision.,4
BestBuy,galaxy,"I have never been one for the new gadget out. I had a grand prime phone before and needed more ram on the phone. Best buy had this phone on sell, and was very helpful it helping me set this up. My provider told me only a certain serial number would work. Best buy told me I would have no problem with this unlocked phone. They were correct. Very helpful even after the sale of phone.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I upgraded from a Galaxy Note 5, a device that I've had for a few years and I absolutely love my new Galaxy S9. It feels right in the hand, the fingerprint sensor location is well thought out and it's very snappy. Android Oreo works well. The only issue I have is with Bixby, which almost never understands me or never does what I ask it to do, so I use Google assistant instead.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"My Galaxy S5 has had issues for some time with short battery life and it seemed like I was always having to swap out batteries 1-2 times daily. Saw a good price and what I wanted at BB and with Christmas around the corner, it was hard not to go for the S9 with all the positive reviews on Consumer Reports.Time will tell!!!!",5
BestBuy,galaxy,I had a Galaxy S7 before I purchased this phone and feel amazed by how much faster and smooth this runs comparatively. My old phone was 2 years old but just the sheer amount of new features built on top of the faster phone made it more than worth the tag price. The sound and video quality upgrade are just icing on the cake,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"The phone has all the latest features from a sharp camera to a new feature that mimics Seri, and called Buxby. It operates at speeds much faster than my s7edge. The only drawback I have found is that the cord for charging has a new camera plug that is different than either the standard android cord or the standard iPhone cord.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"Gifted this to my brother and he is super happy..

I myself have been using S8 for more than a year and so, I readily liked S9. 



Pros that I can list are:

- Good display

- Good performance

- Good battery life



Haven't yet heard of any complaints for S9 from my brother.



Totally happy with this purchase.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,We were looking to replace a phone and wanted it to be the lateset and greatest as we tend to hold onto these things a long time. In the world of Android that meant the Samsung Galaxy S9. Every amazing thing they say about this phone is true. To date we're completely satisfied with the decision to purchasae this phone and anticipate many years of good use.,5
BestBuy,galaxy,"With use of a case, the phone cannot sustain a fall of 42 inches. The glass will crack.

If you don't want to pay for half the phone to fix small cracks, you can try repairing it yourself and break all internal components, when you fail, Samsung will refuse to repair it, even though you are offering them money.

So, if you have a 100% chance of not dropping the phone...",1
BestBuy,galaxy,"I've only had it a few weeks but having fun learning all the things that I can do with this phone. I've been on hikes and walks to shoot some Spring scenes and try out all the settings, especially Pro shots. A few problems because the power button is directly across from the volume buttons and it's easy to accidentally do a reset so be careful. It's due to the slender width.",5
BestBuy,galaxy,"I finally upgraded from my J7 to S9. I love it so far. It runs quickly and seems to be cooperating. It's lighter and thinner than the J7, so that is another plus. The picture quality is sharp and has a lot of fun features to play with (like create your own emoji!). Plus, the price is acceptable, compared to T-Mobile's site....",4

BestBuy,iphone,"I understand that switching from Android to iPhone can take some getting use to but, I wasn't aware that there would be annoying inconveniences. It was difficult establishing an ""Apple ID"" (because of it's confusing codes), which is required to download apps. The tech-support representative didn't even know how. I finally figured it out after by myself after tirelessly switching back and forth trying the different codes. The worst thing about this phone is that if you don't leave the phone unlocked it will timeout and close text messages and forms that you are filling out. I'm a slow texter, and it was a headache continuously having to retext long messages, and filling out the Apple ID application. I'm sincerely considering returning the phone and getting the Samsung s9+.",2
BestBuy,iphone,"This phone is the golden phone!! I love it! It works so good it never locks up, I have GREAT battery life. The IPhone X has a battery life of 10 hrs I think and who is going to use there phone more than 10 hours. Rather than the XS or XS Max there is more battery life for them two but I am never on my phone for 10 hours a day! The IPhone X has a A11 Chip and XS and XS max has a A12 but there is no noticeable difference between them on a daily basis your not going to recognize it. I love my iPhone X and you should get one! Also my Best Buy sales person rocks shout out to her!",5
BestBuy,iphone,"So I bought an unlocked phone by paying the full price. The phone did not have a pin to open the sim slot. And when I started it, it was receiving network which an unlocked phone shouldn't have.

Took it to the store next day and the phone is unlocked but it had a sim card in it which was taken out by the associate for me. 

The phone works fine, but I don't have a pin to change the sim in future. Will have to use a paperclip, I guess.",4
BestBuy,iphone,I love Best Buy but sometimes they have false advertising ads. I bought a new iPhone and the ad had “buy an iPhone get 3 months of Apple Music” but I never got that 3 month trial. I tried contacting bestbuy but after talking to several people they told me it was for new Apple customers but the ad didn’t say new customers. So that’s why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.,4
BestBuy,iphone,"The iPhone X is the latest and greatest when it comes to price. $900 minimum just for the phone. Then there is a $25 activation fee and a $50 case plus any additional accessories like a car charger. I walked out of the store short $1,250.00 The bells and whistles on this phone don't come close to justifying the price.",1
BestBuy,iphone,Got this phone for my son for christmas. He was happily surprised. I really love that Bestbuy offers the refurbished and gently used electronics. They are all good quality and checked out by the pros and it saves me some money. I myself am not an Apple fan but the kiddo is. And he is very happy with it.,5
BestBuy,iphone,"Ordered the unlocked iPhone X 64GB in Silver. The phone arrived in two days and I set it up with my T-Mobile account. It works great and is compatible with all networks including Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T.",5
BestBuy,iphone,I am an iphone guy since beginning. I was in confusion whether to go with XS or X. Ultimately found out both are the same and there is no difference and on a discount price. Great phone.,5
BestBuy,iphone,"Bought this phone with a decent Black Friday discount. Upgraded from an 8 Plus, I'm really glad I did. It's very fluid and fun to use. Gesture controls and face unlock are something that I can't live without now.",5
