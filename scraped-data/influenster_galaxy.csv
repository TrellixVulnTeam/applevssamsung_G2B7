influenster,galaxy,"I use the Galaxy S9 for my work number I currently work for Sprint, so I feel like I'm pretty in touch when it comes to all things cellular. I havent had an trouble with the S9 and I went ahead and bought it outright once I decided I'd be keeping it for a while. The camera could be a bit better (I have the Note 9 too and that camera is fantastic) but its still far better than others currently on the market. The features and customization that Galaxy offers is one of the reasons I love this line so much. I also had an S8 and S8+  and I feel like they top themselves every release. Was very happy to see the fingerprint reader was moved, along with the addition of purple as a color choice. This has been a good, reliable phone so far and I'm very pleased with it.",5
influenster,galaxy,I had a Samsung Galaxy S6 I loved it into that having to switch to an LG for a while and was just able to get a Samsung Galaxy S9 love all the new features it took me a little while to figure out how to do everything on it and not push the wrong button I was nervous about the beveled screen but it's already fail didn't break so So glad I had it in a case. I definitely recommend this to anyone who already loves the Samsung Galaxy phones and even those that haven't  Tried them yet. In has a very easy to use interface nothing to overly complicated just a ton of features Bixby is super easy to use and controls just almost everything on the phone by voice command. The only thing I don't like about it is that instead of having a Samsung music it uses play music to get to the music files on your phone which makes it a little more difficult,5
influenster,galaxy,I currently have the S10e the clarity on this phone is astonishing. I've had it for less than a week and I'm in love with it. Not a disappointing purchase at all and because I bought it through sprint I got free Hulu with it and only pay about $11 a month with a contract free plan.,5
influenster,galaxy,I adore this phone! I got the rose gold one and it so so aesthetically pleasing. The camera is also amazing and as I am a photographer and vlogger that is very important to me. The battery life is also great and the speed is excellent.,4
influenster,galaxy,This phone is amazing. I have not had a single problem with it. I love how great quality the camera has. I enjoy the quality of videos and music. I love the speakers and the battery life. The built in edge screen is everything.,5
influenster,galaxy,"I just got this phone for Valentines/ my birthday and I really like it. It is perfect for my hand. My last phone was huge galaxy edge 6 plus and it really hurt my hand trying to use it. This is more confy and ofcourse everything you love about samsung. Its glass all around so get a shock proof case and screen protector. No home button. All the cool new features. The finger print is easy index in the back. Face recognition, beautiful camera. Extra slow mow and gourgous screen. Ohhh yess way better charger really fast and HEADPHONE JACK üëèüëèüòÇ ofcourse got it just in time for a new one to launch S10 but its ok Im loving it. Oh 2 speakers so sounds great. My last galaxy was really loud too.  Samsung Galaxy S9",5
influenster,galaxy,Battery did not hold a charge i play no games. It lags. Never dropped no scratches. Really expensive to get it checked out by Verizon. It did not meet my expectations that the s8 did. Yes it is reliable. Room for improvement is less curved edges. Samsung Galaxy S9,3
influenster,galaxy,"I actually have an s9+ but I couldn't fund it to review, but they are pretty close in pretty much everything. I upgraded to this phone from an LG stylo 4, and I honestly dont have any real complaints about the phone. I've not experienced any slowness, or problems that are notable. The only thing that really bothers me is the Bixby button. I dont use it, and it really gets on my nerves because you cannot completely disable it. So I'm always hitting the button and it as virtually useless... unless you use those things. Other than that, amazing phone. The edge feature is very nice. Screen resolution is amazing.",4
influenster,galaxy,I absolutely love my  Samsung Galaxy S9. I have my life and everything I need in the palm of my hands thanks to  Samsung.  I love their quality of products and how they continue to amaze me with the new products and technology. This phone has a near professional camera quality & has so many different options to help navigate everyday life,5
influenster,galaxy,"I've just bought my S9 plus and I LOOVE IT! I was always a Samsung / Android buyer and recently upgraded my phone. It is a bit different (in a good way). The camera IS AMAZING, we've compared it to Iphone camera and it took better pictures which was a bit shocking. I still have not had time to explore the rest of my phone but it had me with the camera!",5
influenster,galaxy,Earlier this yeah I purchased a Galaxy S9+ earlier this year. I really love this phone I bought in lilac the color and the look of this phone is so sleek and beautiful I just love it. It's pretty lightweight. The screen is bigger but the display on it is unlike any other. The dual camera on this phone is amazing I absolutely love it!!,5
influenster,galaxy,This phone is amazing! Upgrades from the Note 5. Yes I know plenty have came out but just and no use to upgrade u til the 9+ came out. Mainly wanted it because of the camera and it does not disappoint. I've took pictures and had people ask if I'm a photographer. Besides the camera part the phone is used friendly and has all the latest and greatest stuff you would want with a phone.,5
influenster,galaxy,"I have had 3 galaxy smartphones over the past 7 to 8 years.  I love each one more than the last.  However, the s9 is my favorite.  I like the edge to edge screen, the fact that its then enough to fit in my wallet and dont get me started on the camera.  Leta just say that my digital camera would get jealous of my phone camera if he had feelings.",5
influenster,galaxy,"My boyfriend has the Samsung Galaxy S9, and i have recently been messing around with it. Let me just say, i think it is amazing! Its best feature is definitely the camera. As always, Samsung phones are an investment, but i believe that they are better than iPhones for a bit cheaper price! I 100%recommend trying one out.",5
influenster,galaxy,"Still getting acquainted so not sure how to use all the features. I learn something new everyday. I truly love the camera though, wish the volume could be louder & the airphones it comes with sucks üòù I got a great deal so overall im pleased",4
influenster,galaxy,"I am not an Apple fan and have been using LG the past few years. However, my husband got the S9, and I was intrigued with the camera features. As a social media influencer, I like having a good camera on my phone at all times. The phone is easy to use, and I love all the new features!",5
influenster,galaxy,"I am loving my new Galaxy S9 so far! The screen is bright with dynamic images and the camera is outstanding. I have been loving all the additional features on this phone. I purchased mine through Samsung since they currently have the best deal, plus I was able to get 128gb built in!",5
influenster,galaxy,"Great phone, love the color. It's very easy to navigate,  has face recognition. Great memory space for extra photos, like always samsung does it all wouldnt ever change. The camera as well is great and the sleek design.  Such a great phone my mom got one as well!",4
influenster,galaxy,This is a good quality phone my sister used to have one of these phones it's a really good phone the camera is really nice and clear and it has a nice edge and it's easy to use and light it is a bit expensive but I will still recommend this smartphone,4
influenster,galaxy,Hardly use my phone don't even know why i bought it lol but i definatly loved my iphone more üòè not a phone person maybe thats why. I was so hesitant on the new iphone and this one...,3
influenster,galaxy,It's a beautiful phone. I got mine pink and my boyfriend blue. It's really fast. Besy feature is everything. It meets more than expectations! It's the future!. Its really reliable. Battery lasts FOREVER!! I could go 3 days without charging it. I recommend this amazing phone.,5
influenster,galaxy,I absolutely love my phone! I use the front camera to take most of my photos and they come out just great. There are so many amazing features besides the camera too!!!,5
influenster,galaxy,Got this phone with my upgrade. I had an LG V20 before and love that but this Samsung phone knocked it out of the park! I love the sleek design it has the camera quality is great!,5
influenster,galaxy,"I love my S9 bright and clear resolution, great features that keeps you on your phone to discover a lot of things. The battery life is so great !! It can last up to 18 hours maybe longer I only tested 18 hours with out charging.",5
influenster,galaxy,"Amazing cell phone, my husband gift me a  Samsung Galaxy S9 for Christmas and I think it's a regular phone but no have amazing technology and recognition I love it. I recommend everybody try you gonna love. And if you by in Samsung.com you can get a incredible offer",5
influenster,galaxy,"Honestly, I hate this phone and can't wait to switch back to an iphone. It's slow. The icons move all over if you hold the phone in your hand while it's unlocked. Photos are regularly blurry. Blergh.",3
influenster,galaxy,"I'm so used to Samsung products that this device was a breeze to use. I love the size of this phone, but wish that the Bixby button was in a different spot because I accidentally hit or all the time.",4
influenster,galaxy,My boyfriend loves his new phone. It's all he can talk about and it's making me kind of jealous. It's so fast and the picture on it is so clear. So many new features and little things here and there. I may just have to upgrade myself!,5
influenster,galaxy,"I absolutely LOOOOOVVEEE my s9+ It has an amazing camera, battery life, and the glass, so far, is unbreakable (knock on wood) üòÇI would recommend this to EVERYONE!  Samsung Galaxy S9",5
influenster,galaxy,My s9 is amazing.  I havent had any issues with it at all.  If you are an android fan and Samsung fan to get this phone. Samsung Galaxy S9 bought at Tmobile,5
influenster,galaxy,"Purchased the Samsung s9+ and was not disappointed. Samsung outdid themselves, the camera is superb, the battery is amazing and they even implemented device management so that you no longer have to rely on third party applications.The device is large but fits very nicely into your hands and is very sleek so it is easy to put into and take out of your pockets.Only issue is the Bixby button, which can be accidentally pressed and ends up leaving the screen on... ultimately wasting battery. I understand they're trying to make this implementation work but I think by trying to force it, it ended up backfiring. Instead, they should have made it by double tapping the power it brings up bixby instead of creating an entirely new button, which is very inconveniently placed.",4
influenster,galaxy,"I was a Iphone lover, well as I notice that I needed to get a new phone obviously I was going upgrade to the newer version. My husband suggested to look into The Samsung, trust me when i say i didn't know how many things you can do with this phone. This phone is amazing with the camera, and awesome features it has wow, I will never go back to an iphone again. BTW yes if your a iphone person yes it may take sometime to get use to it. You will love it! :)",5
influenster,galaxy,Finally switched after years of apple use to android mostly due to needing an adaptor for wireless headphone on apple 9 and X. It was a bit harder getting used to but the biggest difference is the amazing picture quality and the battery life. No longer am I tied down to chargers. And not needing to replace chargers is amazing also. Thanks Samsung for designing a great phone. I would have gone with the S9 plus but needed a phone that would fit into my uniform pocket at work and that's a bit too large,5
influenster,galaxy,"I currently have this phone through Sprint. I really like it! I've been using iPhone for the past 5 years so I had to get used to Android again. Let me tell you, a lot has changed lol. I love this phone, but I have issues from time to time loading stuff; even on my wifi, and I had no problem at all with my iPhone. It's not detrimental and it usually functions fine. The features and usability of this phone is amazing!",4
influenster,galaxy,"While your using your phone, make sure you dont burn your hand as this phone gets hot thru using the phone, charging the phone, or even just keeping it to the side. This phone is not a food phone as I have had to get 2 other replacements as the inside gets too hot and messes with the phone (not operational)",2
influenster,galaxy,I have had several iPhones and with some troubles with mine a week ago I went to Verizon and had to get away from iPhones all together. I have had this phone for a couple days now and it's been the best phone I've ever had. The cameras better and the sound quality is amazing. I will never go back!,5
influenster,galaxy,I am using this phone from last april..n it worked good but last month it stopped charging saying moisture detected in port..n i had to take it to samsung repair center and they changed the charging port chip..thats very off because Samsung says its a waterproof device,4
influenster,galaxy,"This is the phone I switched to after having an iPhone for years. Although it has a somewhat hefty pricetag, its sturdy and i can guarantee its going to last me for a long time.",5
influenster,galaxy,This phone has alot of good up grades but the durability of the phone is horrible. If you even bump your phone you it will dent the crap out of it. And if you drop it the phone is done. Recommendations is to get case and screen protector,3
influenster,galaxy,"I have the s9+ and I love it! The camera is awesome, it has Google assistant, Bixby and facial recognition and Iris scanner. Great phone! I like it better than the iPhones",5
influenster,galaxy,I love this phone! I have always had Samsung but my husband traded in his iPhone for the S9. We love the camera. We can get great pictures of our little one without pulling out our giant camera.,5
influenster,galaxy,"I really love this phone. It has a wonderful camera, I can take a very great picture. The only problem is the battery, it is not a very long duration, I have to charge twice daily.",4
influenster,galaxy,"I have the Galaxy s9 now. I broke the screen on it 2 months ago and it is still kicking. I love the feautures on it, It's quick, easy to use and i love the camera.",5
influenster,galaxy,"The battery is not that powerful,  the quality of the screen and the pictures is terrible and i paid it so expensive i really regret getting this phone",2
influenster,galaxy,Love this phone! I previously had a Samsung Galaxy S6 and finally upgraded to this phone. I love all of the features and it has a great battery life.,5
influenster,galaxy,"My last 3 phones have been Samsung..I love them..The S9 takes great pics, the size is good..not too big or too small..I always recommend Samsung üòÉ",5
influenster,galaxy,Just got the phone two weeks ago . I love the camera especially the slow-motion.  I like that it has a wireless charger if you choose to buy it .,5
influenster,galaxy,I have always loved Samsung products I love my s9 the only issue I have is the camera makes everything look so wide. But I recommend this,4
influenster,galaxy,I have the galaxy s9+ and it has been the best samsumg phone I've had. I wish the camera were a but better but overall I love this phone,5
influenster,galaxy,Worked awesome for the first few months and now it's acting all weird with random pop ups and little mini freezes. Has awesome camera.,3
influenster,galaxy,I love the upgrades from the s8. The camera on the s9+ is amazing. And overall quality is great. I do hate how many updates there are,5
influenster,galaxy,Very intuitive technology I love the retina scanner and the updated features I use my phone for alot of freaking and fitness tracking,5
influenster,galaxy,I'm OBSESSED with this phone. I switched over from apple and didn't have any issues with the new software. Best part is the camera,5
influenster,galaxy,Just got it but I love it! It's so pretty. It doesn't seem like there are any interesting new features. I hate bixby but oh well,5
influenster,galaxy,"Probably best device out there in a while.  I love all the updates and the camera is out of this world,  pictures come out perfect.",5
influenster,galaxy,"I've had past samsungs but this one is amazing!!! Love the Samsung s9s curved edge, the fact it can get wet is the best plus!!",5
influenster,galaxy,"I love Samsung product due to being able to add a micro sd card, something Apple doesn't offer. Also, they're sturdy phones.",5
influenster,galaxy,I love Samsung. Their battery lasts wayyyyy longer than ape iphone. Just recently upgraded to the S9. Loving it all the way!!,5
influenster,galaxy,"I've had Samsung galaxy's for awhile, 5, 6, 7 and so on, I love my phone so much not sure if ever switch from a galaxy haha",5
influenster,galaxy,I've been a huge fan of Samsung products for years. This phone lives up to the brand and continues to impress,5
influenster,galaxy,Not too much better than the Samsung Gateway S8. The screen sometimes doesn't work. The camera still sucks.,3
influenster,galaxy,Amazing!! Has to be the best phone I've ever had.  I really like the sleek look with no button on the front.  The finger printer sensor works quickly and I find paying using contactless very easy.  My only criticism is that the battery isn't lasting as long as I would like.  After a year I can't get through a day without at least two charges.,5
influenster,galaxy,"I love this smartphone as it is the one I am currently using. It has an amazing camera, an impressive amount of memory and the infinity display is astounding. The only downside is the battery life, it can last a full day, however, this is something that can be improved. The charging time is super fast and the phone is elegant and beautiful.  Samsung Galaxy S9",4
influenster,galaxy,I am soo glad I upgraded to this phone. I've always had Samsung phones but this is by far the best. Love the sleek design and the amazing features. The battery life is unreal and the phone itself is very durable. Definitely would recommend this phone to anyone.,5
influenster,galaxy,"Always had samusungs and I love this version. I like the curved edges and updates from previous Samsung's, I've dropped it a couple of times and don't even have any scratches which I am impressed by. The camera is very high quality which is great.",5
influenster,galaxy,Este es un telefono de impacto :O es hermosoo!! su camara es fantastica y para navegar en internet es muy rapido ‚ô• Yo recomendaria todos los telefonos de esta marca la verdad son perfectos ‚ô•,5
influenster,galaxy,I had¬† a flip phone for emergencies. Went on a family plan so my daughter got me a Samsung Galaxy and love everything about it. It's affordable with lots of space and the camera is really great.,4
influenster,galaxy,"Smoothest phone experience I've had. My job requires me to test phones, so i've used quite a few. Every other phone I've used has been quite laggy and slow, I've also often kicked out of apps for random errors. My s9 has caused me absolutely no issues, the touch screen is very responsive. The camera is incredible quality, probably the best I've used, although the slo-mo isn't as good as I thought it would be, you have to sacrifice the quality by a lot to do a slo-mo video. The sound quality is also amazing, if you have this phone and haven't enabled Dolby atmos in the settings I highly recommend you do.",5
influenster,galaxy,"I love my phone! I switched to this phone from my iPhone 7, because there's a lot more you can do with Android phones, and I was honestly really scared that I would regret it, but I don't. Not once have I had the thought that I hate this phone. It hasn't given me any problems, the camera quality is good, it has long battery life, and it also is water resistant, which I can prove is true, because two days ago my phone fell in the bathtub, and it's completely fine. I have the S9 in their exclusive purple colour. I think it's great, and definately recommend!",5

influenster,galaxy,"To say Samsung has really brought the full force of the smartphone into S9 ,it has the best camera quality that i have seen in any of the smartphones but it is a bit costly and for this price point it has lot of features !!",5
influenster,galaxy,Omg love this phone and its features! The camera quality speaks for itself. It delivers sharp amazing shots. And the manual camera is awesome too! The battery life is great the rest of the feature dont even get me started on it  just speechless. Worth the buy worth it for any andriod person or apple to android,5
influenster,galaxy,Best smartphone I have ever bought! I've always been a Sony girl but recently decided to give Samsung a go. Definitely the best decision I've made.

There are some features about this handset I love the most-it has 2 speakers on the front, so is much louder than  other Samsung's-it still has it's headphone/aux port and comes with fantastic headphones.- you are able to customise the look of the screen, keyboard, fonts, colours and app icons by applying themes which is a preinstalled app- the screen is fantastic, the phone is easy to use and looks beautiful It has other features like iris unlocking, ar emoji, slowmo mode etc.If you like android, or want to change manufacturer then this is a good place to start. Couldn't live without my trusty samsung",5
