4 out of 5 stars.,"Bought this Sumsung 9 a month ago. Loved it until the latest update, which I totally hate. I feel Samsung is treating me like a child. They do not give me a choice of 'when we do this essential update would you like the look of your apps to change to this as well? Can we change what facilities you have in this area to this?' The latest update has also reduced my battery life by a good 30%, one of the main reasons I stuck with Samsung. My hope is Samsung sort this out for the next update. On the up, the phone is easy to use, has all the features I wanted and is exactly the size I wanted.

4 out of 5 stars.,"I loved my Note 3, but it now has a cracked screen and has the operating system has become unreliable, so a replacement was needed. As the Note 9 was slightly outside my budget, the reduced price of the S9+ was very attractive proposition. So far (after 2 weeks) I am very pleased with the phone. It works well. I like the improved screen brightness and better BT profiles for my headphones. I like the way Samsung try to keep in touch via emails to encourage use of features. I do prefer the slightly wider format of my Note 3. The keyboard is less tight and easier to use on the Note 3. I don't think much of Bixby (like so many others) and has disabled it as much as I can. Maybe Samsung will get there with this feature....Overall it is a great phone.

5 out of 5 stars.,"I started a contract with the s9 recently and have had an overall amazing experience with the phone. The camera is one of the best that i have used on a phone with a very sleek design and a host of fun and useful features. I do however think that bixby is kinda unneeded as i only ever use it to set an alarm when being to lazy to do so but you still have to get into the phone before being able to do so thus making it kinda pointless. Overall it has a really good set of specks that i would recommend to anyone wanting a fun gaming experience. Thanks.

4 out of 5 stars.,"I've had my phone for a few months now and I am enjoying it. Overall, it's a great product. I only have two complaints. The first being that the fingerprint scanner is in an inconvenient place, if the phone is lying on a surface you have to lift it to unlock and more significantly when you use the scanner you will frequently end up smudging the camera lens. Secondly, after only having my phone for a month, I have a major scratch (and quite a lot of micro scratches) in the centre of the screen. I can't fathom how this is possible. I bought an expensive, protective case and I've been very careful with it (never in a pocket or bag shared with keys or anything). I was MUCH more careless with my S7, yet it has less damage to the screen.

4 out of 5 stars.,"I bought this phone 2 weeks ago and after all the comments from friends who have Samsung Galaxy phones [from S6 to S9] it was my dream phone. I am a little disappointed with it. When it arrived I found that the buttons are in a slightly inconvenient place and it's not as easy to operate as my previous Sony Xperia was. I find it awkward to hold without hitting the button to activate Bixby, but I am sure I'll get used to it [it's got to last me a long while]. I find it awkward to close apps I have finished with whilst keeping the current app open. It appears that I can only ""close all"". When I bought the phone I didn't get any accessories, just the handset, so it might have been far easier to navigate if I had a user manual. Lastly the battery life isn't as good as my previous phone. I had hoped for longer. I am still glad I bought it and am confident it will be much more pleasurable to use once I am more familiar wit it. I am certainly not rushing to replace it.

A simple but effective way of identifying who's messaged, without having to dig the phone out of your coat pocket/handbag. If you're expecting an important text, and then get a text from a friend, you won't be panicking to find the phone! Other than that, I'm loving the phone so far, and though not explored all the camera features, I'm really impressed with the photos I've taken so far.

4 out of 5 stars.,"Having got this phone about 2 weeks ago I have found it to be pretty much great for all round use. I like to watch a lot of stuff on my devices so the larger screen has been a joy to see. Great picture quality. I was surprised by the sound quality too, it has a feature where you cant really tell where the sound is coming from if the phone is in front of you, well you can but it's far superior to earlier models.
I know this phone is relatively old now but the fact you can pick one up now so cheaply is Brill! This has been the number one phone on the market for a while and it shows too. The finger print scanner is so quick compared to previous models, great new features such as side swipes etc and also the lack of button on the front is great for uninterrupted viewing. (I've come from a galaxy S7 by the way.
Only negatives really are a bit of a lack of sensitivity around the curved screen parts when touching and the fact that Bixby has a button is a bit pointless. I get the impression Samsung are quite proud of Bixby but in reality, Google assistant is superior in almost all aspects when searching for thing on the web etc. Regarding the phone Bixby has the upper hand......just.

The Bixby button initially found it got in the way accidentally pressing it when trying to turn volume down. It would be good if you could use that button for something else such as a camera shortcut or to take photos. The size and quality of the screen is top quality for watching movies or videos on the go. I found the charging port in the Samsung A5 2017 I had very temperamental and fell out easily. This made me doubt the USB-C connection. The S9 has resolved this issue with a good firm positive connection with the charging lead that sits flush with the bottom of the phone and plastic reinforce of the lead. The addition to the conversions for adapting the USB connectors and micro were really handy and made set up and transferring content a breeze. Locking and unlocking. The iris scanner and facial recognition previously I thought were again a marketing point rather than a functional feature of the phone. The S9 again does this really well and will unlock faster than I can type the 4 to get Password. No issues found with these features.

The 'wall to wall' screen with it's fantastic resolution makes watching films and videos a pleasure.

The sound quality has vastly improved, as has the speed performance. Youtube videos critisize the battery size, but hey, i use it a lot during the day and it's never failed me so far! the only drawback that i've noticed so far is that it doesn't have a dedicated radio function, it only is available through apps which is a bit of a downer. Battery life i think is very good as apps not being used are shut down automatically if you want to save draining the battery.

I'm slowly getting used to my new Sumsung but it's not as simple or intuitive to use as the Nokia was. The Samsung phone settings are harder to control and having random app's (instead of being in alphabetical order) is driving me mad. I tended to use less than 1Gb data a month with my Windows phone, even with roaming switched on. With my new Samsung I've had to turn data roaming off as I used over 1Gb data in the first 2 weeks, which I wasn't expecting, and I still haven't downloaded as many app's as I had on the Windows phone. I'm sure I'll get used to it but at the moment I'm regretting the loss of my Windows phone.

Having had all the ""odd numbered"" Galaxy S's since the original the phone improves noticeably every time I upgrade. I do however miss the physical home button and the permanent touch back and app buttons as I do not like having to swipe up to find them, nor do I like the latest version of Android - Oreo. I'll get used to it, but Android Nougat had everything where you wanted it and made more sense. The phone can't be blamed for the OS, so in all brilliant phone and well recommended.

The phone itself is super sleek and has a great look to it, it feels very sturdy and comfortable in my hands and it's also huge! The screen is massive and takes two hands to use properly but the one-hand function helps that. The camera quality is what shocked me the most, all pictures are so clear and end up looking very attractive with minimal effort. The screen really pops compared to the IPhone and Huawei which I also tried out in the shop. I find the features to be really helpful, and I like using bixby for translating languages as well as identifying foods and the calorific values of then.

I also like the fact that it is a bit more compact than my S7 Edge. Have yet to try out the camera but do like the easier photo album display system. It just feels easier to use. One small niggly bit is that the touch screen seems just a trifle sluggish compared to the S7. It may be me, but I am getting used to it. I'm defo pleased to have upgraded to the S9. Oh, and the battery does seem to last longer on charge compared to my previous phone. I only had the S7 for 18 months so its battery wouldn't have been weakening in such a short space of time. Let's see, what else? Oh, yes...…..it definitely charges up faster, as well. Haven't tried Bixby yet. That's next. One other thing; I am pleased that the sim/SD tray arrangement is the same as the S7. Nothing new to have to get used to.

2 out of 5 stars.,"My first curved screen, what a mistake. It's a nightmare to hold, too big to be comfortable. The curved screen means when held you're constantly clicking things down the side. Even the settings to reduce this don't help. Finding decent protective cases is a nightmare, none work perfectly, if they protect the glass they make it impossible to click anything down the sides, if they protect the fragile sides, the phone becomes even clunkier and makes using it and in hand ache. I stupidly dropped mine and the screen cracked, half the screen stopped working and my cheapest quote for repair was £400. Luckily I pay for insurance so got it swapped quicky and easily. The Samsung interface is also annoying. Bixby constantly appears, always unwanted and trying to disable it is a nightmare and I could never totally get rid. It preferences it's own internet browser and sometimes there's no option to use another, same with opening links and apps when opened don't go to the appropriate apps you'd like. It seems very locked in and unfortunately going the way of Apple. Positives tho, the screen resolution is great, the phone is fast and reliable, and the camera is amazing. - auto focus is lacking, and it's impossible to focus closer than 3 to 5 inches away. Sometimes annoying but I managed to get around this with a third party lense kit that clips over the camera. Sound quality is also OK, better than my TV sometimes, but worse than many other phones I've had in the last few years.

The operating system is also great with so many options to customise the phone to your liking. However what I fail to understand is the camera. On my past phone (iPhone 6s) the picture quality was good but nothing amazing. The galaxy s9 intrigued me with the dual camera and advanced manual modes but sadly I'm very disappointed. The front facing camera is AWFUL, unless in very bright situations faces are very soft and grainy. The outside camera is much better but again in low light situations terrible. I really expected great images as this was a key selling point but sad to say it is false. It's a real shame because otherwise it's a pretty perfect phone. I guess I'll just have to go back to Apple:( So if you want to take photos, this isn't the phone for you. If not I highly recommend it. Samsung please keep up with rival phones pictures. Thank you!

Numerous problems including contious pop ups, poor 4G connectivety, poor phone reception and dead spots on the screen making it a complete nightmare to switch wifi on and off. I persevered with it until day 6 it fell out of my pocket on to the hard airport floor. The screen instantly cracked all around. Now finding it will cost in excess of 200 pounds and I will still have the numerous other issues I have decided to abandon it. It feels like a real step backwards from the S7 which has served me faithfully this last 2 years.

I have only two real complaints: 1. Placing the fingerprint sensor right next to the camera lens is stupid! I end up with fingerprints all over the lens 2. Why on earth don't Samsung provide a simple case like the one I had on the S7. The closest seems to be the one with a transparent front. I don't want that - I don't want the 'always on' alerts and time/date. I want a simple leatherette case but one which wakes up the phone when I open it (and puts it to sleep when I close it) as I had on the S7. This also had the advantage that simply flipping the case open and closed would snooze the alarm which was great!

5 out of 5 stars.,"I've been using this phone in place of my old S6 for a few months now alongside the Galaxy Watch. I'm very impressed with the speed and ease of use especially with the fingerprint scanner now in a much more easy to use position which switches on and unlocks the device in a trice. So far I've had no glitches except I find Iris Scan sometimes fails in bright light conditions so usually use fingerprint. Samsung Pay is very slick a treat to use and does not interfere with the use of my Barclaycard contactless app. The only fault I can find, which was also on the S6 and much talked about on the forums, is that Smart Lock, Trusted Places, is a bit flaky. When you arrive home it works but after the four hour time out, when you unlock it manually again it stops working until you go out and come home again! This is not a problem if you have the watch or some other Bluetooth device at home to keep it unlocked.

It performs great, the camera quality is amazing, I can play high performance games that my old Galaxy J5 could never handle. I haven't found any major issues so far other than the Bixby button. I know that I would never use Bixby because it's just something that I've never particularly liked, so having a button dedicated to something I will never use seems quite useless. I have disabled both Bixby and the button, but now I just have a redundant useless button that I can do nothing about. The ability to re-map this button to something that the user finds more useful like play/pause media or take screenshot or something like that would seriously put my opinion of this phone much higher.

3 out of 5 stars.,"I've had this phone for about 3 weeks. I've always been fond of Samsung. I do like the phone overall- there's a good camera and I like the size. It took me a little while to get used to not having a home button but I quickly got over that. Unfortunately the battery does drain quickly and I find I have to charge it at least once, sometimes twice, to make it through the day. I guess that's probably due to its large screen. Bixby (the siri equivalent) is also very irritating. I don't like having a button to activate Bixby, it's easy to accidentally hit, especially as it sits right next to the volume button. Bixby Home is also unwanted. Another issue I have had is with the curved screen. Despite it looking nice, it isn't always practical. For example, when using apps or games on your phone, when an advert pops up which you wish to close, it can be difficult to do so as the 'x' is usually in the top corners where the screen bends. For some reason, the screen is less sensitive here and I find myself spending a while trying to close anything that may pop up. If you can live with these downsides, then otherwise it seems like a great phone.

3 out of 5 stars.,"I upgraded to the s9 from the s7edge about a week ago and I as yet I am not that impressed. I am not keen on the fingerprint scanners placement on the back of the unit, I find it awkward to use. This may be something that I get used to in time, however when at work my phone will sit face up on my desk and used to be able to access my phone with the scanner at the front. Bixby is a nice idea but I struggle to get it to work successfully 100% of the time. This again may need me to invest some time to it and set up all the features to make the most of it. I have been disappointed with the voice unlock feature as have made several unsuccessful attempts to set this up. I like the easy access to apps sections as well as the multiple options to arrange to home page. I am a huge fan of Samsung phones and hope that with a bit more attention and research to the features I will get the best out of the Samsung S9.

3 out of 5 stars.,"I bought this as I was constantly getting annoyed with other phones updates and problems so I thought I'd go back to Samsung after not using for a fair few years, after first impressions I was pleased and happy to get away from the iPhone but after using it for a few weeks some things just didn't seem to add up.
First off: Battery life: it just seemed to drain itself rather quick and yes I know the S9+ has some battery saving options and performance changes but I shouldn't have to change it every time I play a game or make a phone call. I know it has a fast charge but does it fast charge because the battery is actually smaller?
Speakers: I like the dual loud speakers, it really surprised me when I tried some music for a test, they are both clear and loud much better than the other phones.
Performance: I play games and watch Youtube on my phone quite a lot and I had some issues with lagginess, for example I got to around round 100+ on my other phone with minimal problems, on the S9+ it seemed to lag and even crash once on round 40+ ish, once experiencing this I did close the app and change to the phones optimisation setting for games which it did help to improve a lot. Like I said before I shouldn't have to manually change each time I want to play a game or make a phone call, can you maybe add a setting so that it automatically does that and if you do already have it then maybe make it clearer so that people can automatically change it.
Bixby: OMG can it be any worse, the voice recognition is just horrendous, the commands are stupid and to be honest why do I need Google voice and Bixby? Every time I ask Bixby a question or give it a task like what is the weather or text Mother it thinks and then says something completely different, if I ask Google it does it quickly and smoothly. I know Bixby is new but it needs a lot of work done to it.
Samsung/android/google pay: again why is there multiple wallets? Every time I went to pay for something it would say your card is not set up please activate it... Well I did set it up but with another pay app, why can it not just make one and keep as it as a default.
Features and software: I love that it has facial recognition, a heartbeat sensor and the finger scanner at the back of the phone but at times these either don't work or take a long time to recognise, I'd be standing with the phone to my face and it would just think about it even if I took my glasses off it would still think. With the heartbeat sensor I'm not sure if it's me but every time I use it it takes a really long time then start to count 10%, 50%, 80% then oh no please can you make sure finer is on sensor don't move etc.... sigh okay 10%, 80% oh sorry please do following. My hands are clean, I am sitting still and phone is flat, how can it not recognise this? I even reset the phone and same problems. Finger touch pad seems to be working fine for now.
Other than that I quite like the size of the phone, it's nice and comfortable to use, I like the colour resolution.

I feel like this has the potential to be powerful but is held back by useless stuff, this has 6gb ram that's double my note 3 with it's 3gb ram, yet the os takes up 4gb!? POINTLESS!

Bixby is a very good feature. Easy to use and understand love how you can now use a usb connection with the provided connector. Switching from phone to phone was easy enough. The only downside I think is the battery could have been much better, as it runs out quite quick after a fair amount of use. I also like the wireless charging feature, I recently purchased a wireless charging dock which works pretty well, let's hope samsung can keep up the good work with their updates that would be something to behold, but hey let's hope for the best.

I prefer to do this as power banks are much heavier and then theres the cable to carry. So i got the S9 with its longer lasting battery. All ok until about oct when i found i had to charge it a lot more. By dec im starting the day at 100% then having to charge 2 more times. On a recent day out in London my phone was dead by 5pm and i had barely used it. Not impressed. The rest of the phone is great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Then, they are so slow updating the OS on their devices whilst regularly updating their,own apps. Features and menus are well hidden. Huawei next for me.

4 out of 5 stars.,"I purchased this phone as a replacement for my galaxy S7 and the phone immediately not only feels better in the hand, but is faster and looks better. The phone is a very nice subtle, and not garish colour. The placement of the bixby button is poor, with me often pressing the button instead of the volume down button or when taking a screenshot. I would prefer it if the button was removed altogether and bixby respond to something along the lines of ""Hey Bixby"". The change to the new charging a data transfer port was, as it always inevitably will be, rather inconvenient. However the inclusion of a male to female converter which I can attach to my old charging cable is brilliant and shows a fantastic attention to detail. The camera is fantastic, and I have nothing specific to mention bar the fact that a filter should be fine tuned and created to allow people who have reef aquariums, with lighting that requires very tedious professional mode tweaking to avoid the image being awash blue, to use a filter which automatically does this. A quick google will reveal many people having this same issue with all phones and the addition of this filter would put the phone ahead especially in the reefing community where a large sum of people are turning to third party applications.

3 out of 5 stars.,"Good phone, good fat hardware. Always the latest software on top of the range Samsung phones. Small form factor despite large screen. My main reason for using Samsung phones is their efficient use of ram and the fact they are fairly future proof compared with other phones I've had. Ram doesn't clog up if you close apps regularly, and apps don't become unusable due to software obsolescence. Big down size is from the s7 onwards it is glass backed, and glass fronted. I my s7 I had two insurance claims within six months from simply dropping my phone. Make no mistake, if you drop it it will shatter. My current phone is the s9. It is slim, and with its infinity screen should be easy to use with one hand....BUT it isn't, as like many other galaxy users i have to carry it around in a large bulky case and use a screen protector. COME ON SAMSUNG THE TECHNOLOGY FOR TOUGHENED GLASS WAS AROUND ON MY ORIGINAL SONY XPERIA ALONG TIME AGO. MAYBE NEXT UPGRADE I WILL SWITCH FOR THIS REASON AND THIS REASON ALONE. This move towards phone fragility seems to be a sinister money making move, but as everyone seems to be carrying there mobiles in egg boxes these days , it might be a wiser move to stand out from the crowd and build a toughened glass small form factor phone. IF YOU STOP BUILDING PHONES OUT OF EGG SHELLS I WILL STICK WITH SAMSUNG ON MY NEXT UPGRADE!

The camera is superb. Display and colour is very good and clear. When reading the edge to edge screen gives the feeling you are reading from a page. I really like the Samsung Health app. The stress, heart rate and oxygen saturation reader are very neat.
Retina scanner is a cool gizmo to show friends but in reality never gets used.
Finger print scanner and location is brilliant.

Huawei p9 and only moved to Samsung for cost and a better deal with my provider. The phone I really wanted was out of my price range but I thought Samsung would be ok. And it is only an 'ok'. I've turned Bixby off, didn't need it & prefer to stick with Google pay instead of Samsung pay. I thought the battery life would be better being a new phone but it's really on par with my p9 (toward the end life of it). I'm not too keen on the edge and the camera is confusing! Now I'm stuck with it till my two years are up.

The camera is brilliant in natural light but looks over filtered in dull lighting or in the dark. Also if there’s a slight movement the pictures are blurred. Not any use if you take pics of your kids. Didn’t pick up my fingerprint to unlock or it took 3/4 attempts. The retina access did not work on my eyes either. It would not even let scan my retina, so my anatomy must not be up to the Samsung S9 standard. I had the phone 9days, it has now been returned.

My concerns were the battery, & the Camera...the photos are super sharp & clear with a 12 mega pixel, & the battery is around 8 hrs..for me it lasts 3 days before recharging.

3 out of 5 stars.,"I had an S7 Edge and I liked it so wanted to simply upgrade. The S9+ seemed a logical option. My only issue with the S7 was that the Bluetooth would not play music in my car, despite being able to take and make calls. I thought the newer model would resolve this...and it sort of has...but I need to unpair and pair the phone every time I get in the car, which is annoying. So better, but still not perfect.

4 out of 5 stars.,"I upgraded to s9 from s6. The camera is every bit as reviewed and it has taken some really outstanding photos in low light. The quality far exceeding that of photos taken at the same time by my step daughter with her new iPhone ( much to her frustration!).
It's a huge relief that the s9 is water resistant, but this hasn't been tested yet!
I still keep hitting ""invisible"" keys without meaning to and I'm not yet convinced by the edge shortcuts when you can have them on your home screen. I also haven't made friends with Bixby despite Bixby's best efforts (personal choice...maybe we'll get to know one another over Christmas).
Not sure of the point of iris recognition that can't work unless you take out your contact lenses but finger print security seems improved and face recognition sort of works in good light and after a couple of seconds.
Much of the bread and butter stuff ...The actual phone, internet, integral software etc is much the same as with the s6. Switching was ridiculously easy and flawless.

I had the S6 Edge version which I thought was good but this phone can do so much more which I am still discovering. Photo are much sharper and easy to use. However battery life could be better as I feel I am charging everyday where as before it was very couple of days.

2 out of 5 stars.,"Prefered my old S6. The only good thing about the S9 is the battery life and the ability to do slow motion video. I would have thought by now we could have more colourful backgrounds like Android Jellybean did. I was disappointed with the Nougat on my S6 and thought that Oreo would be a welcome change, but there's not much difference that I can see. It's still plain, boring and white and becoming more and more like an iPhone, which I hate. Features I expected to still be here are the ability to insert our own text backgrounds and callouts, but all we have is a boring white background for contacts, texts, settings screen etc. Another annoying thing is that when having a conversation via speakerphone, the screen goes black so I'm having to keep on pressing the power button to keep the screen on, this makes it harder when you also need to hang up the phone as it takes longer to end the call and by the time you press the power button to display the screen, the other person hangs up instead. I hate how the home button is now part of the screen. Preferred having a real button to press, much more responsive.
I was hoping that this phone would be a vast improvement on my S6, but I wish I hadn't bothered buying the S9 now. I await a software update in the hope that some of these features can be reinstated (obviously nothing can be done about a physical home button), but PLEASE, Please can we have more colour instead of glaring white. Maybe get rid of Oreo and introduce a name with more colour like 'rainbow drops'.
I can't see me keeping this as long as I did my S6. I should have kept hold of it. Only got rid of it as I was fed up of Nougat and wanted different Firmware

Some of the set up options aren't intuitive, for example I'm seemingly stuck with the default message tone. Also, it has decided to reinstate a keypad click a week after I turned it off. The fingerprint scanner on the back is a little inconvenient too.
Despite all this it's a good upgrade over my old 2017 Alpha, the processor is noticeably quicker than the old one and it's a pleasing object with the curved screen.

The colours are extremely vibrant and the blacks are deep black with no back-light bleed. Watching movies, playing games or just simply browsing is very comfortable with this screen.
Speakers make or break a phone in my opinion and the speakers on this phone certainly make this phone. With stereo drivers, this phone not only looks, but sounds amazing - I can even hear a slight bit of low-end with them. It uses Dolby Atmos which sounds incredible and certainly compliments the already fantastic speakers.

on a whole I would rate the s9+ as 95 out of 100. and the only reason I don't give it a perfect score is due to Bixby. (google is supreme to Bixby. as Bixby is yet to have English uk and because of this struggles with dialects I have found myself from southwest and friends from Liverpool London and midlands have all tried and continue to fail with Bixby.)
however now that negative aspect is covered ill say the battery life on this phone is awesome way beyond expectations, the process speed is perfct the scree rss perfect ..... to sum up what will be a lot of positives I would happily buy this phone again and again. between my old s4 mini and my new s9+ Samsung have assured that as long as there prices remain reasonable and they products of a good standard then I will remain Samsung.

5 out of 5 stars.,"I've been a proud Samsung Galaxy S mobile user ever since the release of the S2 and have enjoyed it. Great looking devices all of them. When i moved to the S4 I was overjoyed with the improvements made to the line............ I was a little concerned coming from the S4 to the S9 but any personal dislikes I had of the newer design for example the Unibody and the no physical home button were quickly quelled within the first day of using. The screen was the main reason i went for the S9 in the end and WOW what a beautiful screen it is indeed. Very clear with gorgeous deep blacks and sumtious colours.............. but it was a difficult toss up between the Huawei P20 pro, the OnePlus 6T as alternatives. The camera way outperformed my expectaitions and the speakers..........wow, that was an amazing surprise to say the least. Overall I would have to say I am extremely happy with my new mobile and hope to have a great experience for the next few years. Top job Samsung :)

I've not used Bixby, I prefer Google assistant as I have a lot of Google home accessories such as lights etc.
All other features are excellent, I love the edge panel which keeps the home screen less cluttered. The all important battery life is perfect for me, I'm not a heavy user but do spend a lot of my day using various chat and social media apps, listening to music via headphones and my Gear S3 watch is connected all day. My phone is charged over night, switched on at around 7.30am and easily lasts until 11.00pm.
The camera is excellent, images are bright and clear even in low light.
Sound is better than on my S6 but I still use it with a Bluetooth speaker as (unsurprisingly) it still sounds like a mobile phone.

But i dont like that when using spotify it doesnt appear on the homescreen as it did on my s6 edge for example when listening to podcasts i am unable to skip 15 seconds from the lock screen also whenever i pause it it dissapears which is kknd of a nightmare. I do prefer having a physical home button and back button that i can press. This phone is very pretty though i love how easy it is to use. The camera is great the only problem is it zooms in too much when you havent even used the zoom feature. My face appears a lot closer than it is and i prefer my face to be a lot further. The apps and software are amazing but i would love to have a screen record feature as apps have to be downloaded in order to save some videos which isnt ideal.

I would also like to see a predictive text t9 keyboard available like my 'non' smart phone had! The qwerty is far too fussy. The addition of a suggested emoji feature to said keyboard would be invaluable. Bixby keeps appearing when I press things by mistake which is very irritating as I have no need for a virtual ai assistant. The smartview feature in the gallery is impossible to access in order to change the settings on it. Other than that, the phone is fine.

The clarity of the screen is exceptional and the smart phone upgrades compared to my old faithful S6 are obviously noticeable, speed is a clear winner here. However my main gripe is the fingerprint biometric scanner placement, long fingers and large palm people no problem for you but it's still the most awkward thing to use, so you guessed it I use the password code instead, which really defeats one of this machines key features. So try before you buy not everyone will be comfortable with the fingerprint scanner placement.

The 'Apple' has fallen far from the tree for me, having ditched the rotten fruit, and picked up a tastier gigabyte to eat. With the S9's powerfully superior storage capabilities, I haven't had to worry about the galaxy of crisp and ultra-vivid photos and videos I've been taking, or the amount of crystal-clear music I've had the pleasure of being enveloped by, thanks to the ultra-comfortable, highly revered super-sonic AKG headphones provided.
The sky's the limit on personalisation, giving you new worlds of possible adaptive content and design options. Clever tricks and shortcuts mean you're well equipt for wholly satisyfying functionality, and near NASA-grade navigation.
All in all, the Samsung Galaxy S9 equips you fully for a new world - a dynamic, connected and limitless journey into possibility, immediacy and exploration. There's no 'i' in this phone, but there's a Galaxy of 'us' with the Samsung S9.

5 out of 5 stars.,"I just switched from an iPhone 5s to galaxy s9 and it's gorgeous! It works amazing- not laggy like my iPhone. It's so nice to not have to worry about storage or have to deal with annoying iCloud pop ups (or, y'know, icloud). There's been a small bit of difficulty transferring data from my old phone to this one but I think that's mostly my old phone's fault because it was dodgy syncing with anything and there's nothing I really miss apart from a few numbers and photos which I emailed over anyway. I adore google apps like slides, docs and drive (which have already saved my butt twice in two weeks). The phone itself is gorgeous and so nice to use, it was easy to switch from iOS and the edge screen is beautiful and functional! I was vaguely concerned about going to a bigger phone because I have tiny hands and the iPhone 5s fit my hands perfectly but this is so much easier than I thought and the one handed mode just makes it that small bit easier. Screen protectors are difficult and I've found one that isn't perfect but I can deal and the extra sensitivity setting in advanced features helps a lot. Wireless charging is such a lifesaver I've never encountered and I'm wondering how I dealt without! Definitely recommend!!!

5 out of 5 stars.,"I purchased an S9 as a replacement for my 3 year old S6. There was nothing wrong with the S6, I just wanted an update. The S9 is light and the screen is wonderfully sensitive and tactile. The 'new' USB-C cable is a vast improvement in the Micro USB that was so fiddly and had to be inserted the right way up, although this change has meant needing to change all my cables and accessories - an expense I had not budgeted for. Transferring my data and setting up was simple, although some specifics needed to be sorted manually - ie individual contact ringtones. The S9 has all the bells and whistles you could possibly need - and more you don't; ie AR Emojis! I really can't see where mobiles can go from here, but then tech is moving at a fast rate so you never know.

3 out of 5 stars.,"I bought the s9 a couple weeks ago. Generally speaking it's a good phone and im sure in time I'll find it more usefully but for now: Bixby is annoying and doesn't really understand what I'm saying. I don't like the fact that there is a dedicated button to it. Keep pressing it by accident! Samsung Pay won't let me register because cards by Barclays aren't supported. Because I have come from using an s6 for four years I'm still getting used to there not being an actual home key and that all the buttons are now touch. Another problem I'm having is that some of the notification sounds for text seem to go off 7 times in a row, rather than just once! Features I am liking are the speed of the phone, the different camera options which can be fun, the selfie mode is also fun. I also like the quality of the video.

The only thing that annoys me is the bundled software you can't get rid off. They know people will swap the messaging and call apps etc so why not just let them uninstall it. Other than that.

The Super AMOLED Infinity display is spectacular. Along with the superb, rich sounding and clear audio from the dual stereo speakers, I am able to watch videos and movies in breathtaking quality. The device operates smoothly, especially when taking on tasks such as browsing the web and social media. The camera is also faultless, with the ability to take amazing low light photos- thanks to dual aperture. The 960fps super slow motion feature on the camera is also outstanding and fun to play around with. Overall I am very impressed, and I am very proud to own this phenomenal device.

The only downfall to this phone is the stubborn samsung apps. For example I can't remove the photo app and replace it for google photos. So I have two apps going. (I know first world problems) but it would be great to have more options. Also Bixby is hilariously bad. Particularly once you compare it to google assist.

And I don't like texting or editing photo's when the app tries to do it for you. Rather than making it simpler, it is more confusing.

After using Apple I Phones from the 3G/3GS onwards my first move to Android was with this phone, from the seamless transfer, the S9 has been a pleasure to use, ultra fast with a stella screen ! My only challenge with this has been getting a robust but ultra thin screen protector but bar that I am really happy with the S9.

The only issue I have found when doing the switch is that there is no app to take my old books from my iPhone over to the s9 and my bank does not support google pay.

4 out of 5 stars.,"I have been an iPhone customer for the last 7 years, I have had enough of apple and decided to make the switch. I have not been disappointed with the S9, its a really great phone. There are certainly more pros than cons, I just find that in terms of ease of use the iPhone wins for its simplicity whereas these are small computers and as such have to operate it like a computer. For me I wish there was a simpler layout, it's feels too much is going on at one time. Plus I have been extremely disappointed with the battery life.

I've always had iPhones, but sick of the extreme price hikes and method in which Apple admitted slowing them down over time, so I swapped to android and couldn't be happier. Only thing I wish I'd done was actually physically seeing the s9. This is because I probably would have got the s9+ instead, but now I've bought a new case and just got the settings to my taste, I can't be bothered to change it again lol.

5 out of 5 stars.,"Bought my phone two weeks ago and I'm so glad I did! I upgrade every 3 years and I was very excited to get the new S9 (in purple!). The phone's design looks and feels good and has adapted perfectly to my everyday life style. The battery lasts very well, at least two days of use currently! The camera quality is amazing, as Samsung always is. I was unsure of Bixby initially but it's a very handy feature when you are on the go and need something done quick. Alongside this, the phone speed is brilliant and is quick to respond. The phone itself isn't cheap and you are paying the ""Galaxy"" range price, but I do feel you get what you pay for when it comes to Samsung. It took a few days adjusting to the new fingerprint reader but I'm definitely in the swing now. The response is much improved compared to my previous model. I fully recommend the S9 to anyone who is willing, or considering, taking the leap.

Had a few issues with crashing apps which was not what I needed the first time with a samsung but they seemed to fix themselves on updates, as an Apple user before, do i think this is better? Size yes, option for memory yes, just as fast, now I can now change themes and screen shot with a swipe of the hand, I would say apples software is slightly better but overall I'm glad I made the switch.
Only thing what's not to great is the battery, same size as what I had with my iPhone x. Still decent (2 charges a day and constant media use) but not as good as I had expected.
All in all, if samsung don't change the slim size with their next models I may just upgraded to samsung again , deep not missing my big bulky boring iPhone.

So if you are a woman who isn't in this category then expect to have to set up your emoji as a male :(

4 out of 5 stars.,"The screen! Oh my lord how beautiful is that screen. I bought a refurbed iPhone X with a view to downgrading my contract to sim only when up for renewal. Renewal time came and I immediately upgraded to a sunrise gold S9. iPhone X is so lacking in comparison. Android is taking a bit of getting used to but the hardware so makes up for that. I cannot stop picking it up to look at that screen. The feel in the hand is lovely, so thin and narrow even though the screen is the same size as iPhone is feels much smaller. The reasons I haven't given it 5 stars is battery life could be better. Even though it isn't an issue it means the handset is not perfect. Also is the epic failure of Android Auto on my car (relied on CarPlay a lot), which I realise may be an app issue but could Samsung do something to help it run better in their device maybe?????? Would be lovely if all colours were released at launch and available to buy on Samsung website. I wouldn't particularly choose to buy the blue pink or black.

This year I decided to take the chance and convert to something new, hence the s9 which I bought, June this year, via a contract with Vodafone.So far the camera is good, software is average and the battery....meeeeh. I have charged my phone to 100% before going to bed and when I woke up I was dismayed to see that it had consumed 3-5% of its energy overnight, eventhough I was not doing anything with it. It's kind of subpar compared to the battery performance of my iphone 6 before when it was still fully 100% when I wake up after charging it the night before. I've been using the phone for the last few months biu to tell you the truth the battery is really frustrating. Good thing I still have my spare phone to use together with the S9 otherwise I would not be able to last a day. I am really trying my best to make my S9 my daily driver but it just could not cope and battery drains really fast. I still have more than 1.5 years with the contract but I can't wait for it to end so that I can buy a phone again that I could really rely on. Sadly, this is the last time I'll use Samsung again P.s. Just typing this review already consumed 3% of my battery and it's on power saving mode to boot. Such a pathetic battery life.

However, the camera is great and good quality, the only downside is the selfie camera is not the best of quality indoors but never mind! It's still a great phone and easy to use with a good clear display. I've heard there's been issues where the fingerprint scan is (close to the camera lens) and Bixby button is annoying, however, not once have I accidently touched the bixby button and never touched the camera lens!

I haven't been able to find it yet, which is very disappointing, as I rely on that. Also, the ""Always On Display"" function doesn't work. It's there in the list of options, but the lettering is in grey, and not black like the other options, so when I try to click on it, nothing happens. How can I fix this problem please?

Slimmer to use and easy to use, except the feature of the hidden task bar at the bottom which takes some getting used to! Amazing camera as expected and all around stylish phone. The only downside is the battery life - it isn't as long lasting as I'd expected, the s7 edge (as new) lasted around 17-24 hours with moderate use but this one at max has lasted 16 hours but about 10-13 hours on average so far. Definitely worth the upgrade though, I do love it!

The camera quality is really good, even when moving and I love the full screen. The colour range that you can get this phone in is really good as it makes the phone that little bit more personable and unique (I have the purple and absolutely love it!) You can also change some of the features on the phone such as colour backgrounds for the navigation panel and app backgrounds which again helps make it that bit more personal to you. The phone runs fast and hasn't slowed down at all, even with all of my apps, music, videos or photos. Love the Samsung Galaxy range and would HIGHLY recommend to anyone.

For example, the iris recognition system is near flawless! The phone feels great to use, and everything is an incremental improvement on the Galaxy S7. It is not perfect, I have difficulty getting the voice activation to work, both Bixby and Google. But I don't use these features anyway, so I'm not worried.

5 out of 5 stars.,"I bought this phone a couple of weeks ago, after not having had a proper phone for two years. It's honestly the best buy I could have made. I was getting sick of phones ( starting with I) and this was a great switch. I'm enjoying that the finger scanner is on the back of the phone, it's way easier if you have small hands. I usually had to use both hands to unlock other phones, with the scanner in front, in order not to drop it and shatter the screen (which has happened before). Bixby is also a delight, I much prefer it over Siri. You have a button for Bixby (that you can accidentally press a couple of times, but it's no big deal) it's way better than having to talk to your phone like a maniac in public, to activate it. The layout is better. The options to customise are endless. And it just overall looks better. I'm definitely never going back to using other phones again

4 out of 5 stars.,"The phone in general is really good, both in its appearance and in functionality. There are a few little things that I find irritating though! The Bixby Voice Assistant has a designated button that I would rather assign other functions to, but I have thus far been unable to do this. To make matters worse, it is positioned opposite the lock button and immediately below the volume key, so it often gets activated inadvertently.
I also do not understand why the phone doesn't have a selection of actual ring tones? There are an abundance of stupid tunes and noises that I struggle to comprehend anyone actually using, but hardly anything that constitutes a ringing phone. Was the user research done with a group of 5 year olds?
My final annoyance is that between Samsung and Google / Android, the phone is extremely imposing, especially when it is new. Constant notifications and pushing of services and functions.
The above issues aside, the phone is slick operating and looks smart and it charges very quickly, which is a real bonus. The battery life is decent if not outstanding and I manage to get a day's use between charging - I do use it for a lot of music playback and some watching of movies and TV during my commute though.
On the subject of watching movies and TV, the screen is very sharp! The camera and video capture are also excellent, which is another bonus having moved over from Sony - there camera was very good and I did have a slight worry that this may be a step down, but it isn't!
This is my first Samsung and I like it, I do wonder if the S9 was work the money though, as my friends have S8 and I don't really see much difference.

5 out of 5 stars.,"I'm a big fan of Samsung phones so when my A3 died, I was on the lookout for another. No phone manufacturer seems to make a phone as small as the A3 anymore so it was impossible to get one as small as I needed. However, after using a borrowed S9 for a week, I realised it was dramatically bigger and it would do what I wanted and oh, so much more ! I haven't had time to figure out many of the features yet as I've only had it a week but I love it already. My favourite feature so far is the fingerprint unlocking. The only down side I've found is that the battery life seems pretty poor compared with any of my previous Samsung's and I'm having to charge it every day. Hopefully it will settle down because you can no longer replace batteries and have to buy a new phone altogether if it fails and that's not something want to have to do again for a long time.

The only downside (which taking all things into account is a VERY small downside) is the performance on WhatsApp is not as easy and fast to use compared to an iPhone. For example, seeing the read receipts takes a lot more time than simply swiping left or right and to forward messages also ta knew considerably longer.

The curved screen means hitting the edged area not only feels strange but it's difficult to tell if you have pressed the correct bit. I don't like the home bar at the bottom. The new charger port means having to carry the little adapter around with you everywhere because no-one has a charger for this phone. When I want to hang up the phone and move it from my ear the screen hoes blank and you have to fiddle about with it to get it back on just to disconnect. Curved screen protectors no matter which ones I've tried make it very difficult to use the phone even with the sensitivity increased. These are all trivial things I know but it sure means a long 2 years ahead with a phone that's just not up to scratch. Sorry Samsung.

Voice calls are great, sound is great, fast charging is very good and the security is excellent, face id, fingerprint etc, works first time. Nearly everything is perfect except for, Bixby is sometimes hit and miss, more miss than hit, volume rocker should of been put on the other side of the phone and battery life could be a bit better.

2 out of 5 stars.,"I've only had this a few weeks and upgraded from a Note 4 only because I needed a better camera. The screen gives me head aches and makes me go cockeyed, have played with settings which eases it but can only look at it so long. It constantly slips in my hand therefore im finding im gripping it with some pressure causing discomfort in my hand and fingers. Also the slide up back key doesn't stay up long enough. For example on Insta and some other apps its a race to double tap to back out of certain screens. As ads are the bottom of many apps or the send button sits under the bank key I've been clubbing ads and sending msgs which I was intending to back out of. It does have many great features too which is a given upgrading from the dinosaur age. I like that you can move apps around from the screens to which it downloads to Initially. I like that you can change themes so easily. Brilliant camera. Although wish you could increase the size of the widget clock more than what is available. Those are my only qualms but wrote important ones. Bar being able to not keep the phone in my hand and not look at it it's good lol.

5 out of 5 stars.,"This is my first Samsung phone after switching from another brand I was a long term customer of. Very, very impressed so far. The S9 does everything you'd expect a premium phone to do and it does it all well. Everything I've thrown at it, it's managed effortlessly. It's a breeze to set up and transfer everything from your other handset, smart switch is fast and easy to use. Great size, clear crisp display, great camera and loads of storage space. Oh and it's FAST. Only issues so far (And they're petty minor): Bixby button. I get why Samsung are keen to push Bixby, but give us the option of remapping the hardware button to something users might find more practical for them. Also duplication of software. Do we need Samsung pay/fitness when there's android specific apps competing for use? It'd be a bigger problem where storage space was at a premium, luckily the s9 doesn't suffer from that! All I'd ask for are a bit more user customisation options so that we can have the phone running exactly the way we want with what we want on it. Other than that the S9 is a very, very capable phone. It looks good, it performs well - what more could you ask for?

I've had my S9 for just under a week, although I'm on my phone all day every day for work so it's had a lot of use, and the call quality & mobile signal are noticably much better.

5 out of 5 stars.,"This is my very first contract phone, as having recently turned 18, and I am very happy with it. The facial recognition is amazing, the new position of the fingerprint scanner is really well thought out and makes it so much easier to use as a password for banking apps etc.
The only complaints I do have about this phone are as follows; 1, the Bixby button is annoying. I don't personally use Bixby so having a dedicated button to it that I can't even re-map in the settings to something else is just kind of irritating 2, the animated emojis that Samsung have tried to implement really don't work. They're cool and all and don't really play a massive part in the operation of the phone, but honestly they kinda suck.
Other than that, it's a pretty amazing phone. It runs really well, the speaker quality compared to that of the s7 edge is fantastic, I can use my phone as a speaker to listen to music or watch films without the need for a Bluetooth speaker to make it louder. The screen quality is great, even though the decision to make it an odd ratio is still questionable, with either having black bars on the side of videos or losing some of the top and the bottom of the video in order to have it fill the screen.

4 out of 5 stars.,"I have been struggling with a Galaxy S5 for far too long and it effectively gave up the ghost during a trip to Bristol, overheating and refusing to enable the flash (possibly due to the camera being intensively used?), leading me to get a replacement - and plumping for the Galaxy S9.
Transfer across of apps/data was very simple. Most worked just by logging in to my Gmail account, Samsung SmartSwitch took care of the rest. I had a slight issue with getting my old S Memo files imported into Notes, but it did work eventually. The speed increase of the phone, and the improvement in battery life, was a revelation. The improvement of the fingerprint scanner was amazing! It is also a more natural location than on the S8, my index finger just rests on the scanner automatically when I hold the phone, so it always unlocks as I pick the phone up. Better than my works iPhone! I know reviews have said there is little reason to upgrade to the S9, but from a phone more than a generation old, there is every reason, and in my opinion, worth the premium on other phones in the market.
I chose the black phone and glad I didn't agonise about choosing a colour. The reason? The phone is just too slippy for me, and it regularly fell of my table (very slightly tilted) onto the floor. I bought a rubberised cover for it, and it made the phone much more secure in my hands, and much less likely to get dropped and broken. If I had gone for a coloured phone, I would have lost the colour and felt it was a waste!

It really is gorgeous to look at. The sound quality is incredible, it is not tinny at all, just pure beautiful sound, even if quite loud. Screen is the most crisp I've ever had (I ditched my iPhone for this baby, and I'm not regretting that decision one bit, I can tell you!!) Google apps and music and features are brill on it, so not missing apple stuff, end of! Call quality is also very good. Graphics on texts are nice, nice little touches on ""contacts"" as well. A good design overall, in all aspects - both the way the physical phone looks and feels as well as the fonts and graphics are appealing to the eye. - So tah dah, onto the camera: the camera is the best I've ever had; I love the vibrant, good quality photos and videos I can take with this phone. It's a dream, it really is. I've made the screen to look the way I want, I've kept and added the apps I want, I like it that I can customise the phone quite a lot, so it looks like me.

1 out of 5 stars.,"however I've had the phone for near on a month now, and it seems incapable of finding a network, especially when I leave a wifi zone (like home or work), it needs rebooting before I get any coverage at all, and then it is poor - I got better coverage in the wilds of Alaska with my previous phone than I do in the City of London with the S9. Although I was able to transfer everything from my previous phone, the S9 seems to succeed in logging me out of my apps and some I have not been able to log into (even connect via Facebook) since I have had the phone. On a positive note the camera is fantastic, but I wanted a phone with a camera, not a camera with an occasional phone.

IP68 is brilliant although I've put it in a case because it's so slippery, but that pretty much h applies to most high end phones these days.

I could use fingerprint but because i'm so used to it being within the stretch of my thumb (last phone being the S7) and because i use a wallet case to protect the phone it's annoying having to go to the back to use this feature. Also typing in passcodes constantly is annoying. The slow-motion feature on the camera is ok but could be improved to shoot slow motion when i want it to, not when it wants to (as in waiting for something to move within the yellow square, but even then it's doesn't always detect movement). There's not a whole lot i could say about what i like because i'm a big fan of Samsung and i loved the S7. The S9 is very very similar, not much has changed at all.

4 out of 5 stars.,"Everything is good ,except Bixby, it's very unresponsive even when you do advanced voice settings. Also the press & hold is a bit difficult as it's straight opposite the power button. I frequently press the power button as well, by mistake or don't hold the Bixby button down properly. A hard press or double tap would be better. Bixby is new & no doubt you will upgrade her. Google assist is responsive to my voice only every single time, Bixby, even after saving your voice hundreds of times is still frustrating unresponsive. I expect this is why most S9 users disable her. Google assist only records your voice 4 times & then it's set to recognise you every single time. On the plus side this is a fast, intelligent phone. With a lot of power & clever biometrics. The iris scanner/face scanner/finger print scanner etc, work almost perfectly. I'm quite sure there are still hidden gems I haven't yet found. I'm a bit disappointed there's no way to customise contacts notifications (I mean between each individual contact) also I don't see any improvement in the edge screen. I upgraded from the s7 edge & there are features on there that aren't on the s9. Like swiping the edge screen to see your motivations etc. Also no way of customising edge lighting from app to app, or contact to contact. I'm sure Samsung will address some issues, but I won't hold my breath. That being said if Bixby was as responsive as Google assist it would be a 5 star rating. Overall I'm happy with the phone, but I don't see much change from the s7 edge. The infinity screen shows on advert it covers the sensors/cameras (or goes around them) but in actuality it doesn't. Samsung can fix all these issues with 1 update.

2 out of 5 stars.,"I hate this phone.
I miss my S7. I know my grumbles are the pettiest of first world problems, but my life is on my phone. The S7 brought me joy. 30 cycling lock screens to cheer me up whenever I turned on the screen. The S9? one. Just one. Why remove that feature?
I was told I could either A) install a recommended 3rd party app, that when I read reviews turned out to be buggy and riddled with ads, or B) a screensaver that, get this, scrolls images while the screen is turned off AND is on charge. Who stares at their phone when it's not in use? I charge my phone at night, when I sleep. What's the point? I want my cycling lock screens back.
The phone has a dedicated Bixby button under the volume rocker. I have ZERO idea why. It's pointless. You just press it accidentally when picking up your phone or hitting it by accident instead of volume. Then you have to endure the irritation of cancelling Bixby. You can swipe the home screen, so why add a button you can catch?
And I mean Bixby? Really? When I'm sat on the bus or at work you better believe I'm absolutely NOT going to call my phone 'Bixby' out loud.
TBH I find Bixby absolutely pointless anyway. It's not as good as Google's assistant, (which is FAR less intrusive and in-your-face) and I don't use Google's assistant anyway. Bixby does nothing I can't do myself. I could disable it altogether of course, but I have to grant it a page and a half of permissions that I absolutely do NOT agree to, just to turn it off? WHY??
And I can't disable Volte either apparently. I don't need it. I don't want it. I have unlimited calls, but not unlimited data so why force me to make HD phonecalls over data? And what's the point of the icon taking up space if it's always on? Like the NFC icon. Pointless.
Ok, so the camera is much improved. It's sharp, it has a ton of features for better photos and it's easier to use. The display is bright and sharp, but the curve means you can't see the edges of your image and it means if you place it face down to prevent the blinking light from distracting you it's liable to slide and hit the floor.
It does have better audio though. It's much louder. clearer and less tinny.
That's it. The camera and sound are the only features I like so far. I'm sure I could find more features if I hunted, but I don't want to pick it up, let alone hunt for redeemable qualities. The improvements, for me personally, are not worth all the garbage that comes with this phone and losing the features I loved. I'm stuck in a contract with a phone that that simply irritates me to use.
I hate it.

My wife is on her 4th or 5th Samsung phone, so we have a long history of loyalty, and knowledge, of their phones. It's battery life is poor considering the lead in times they have prior to launch. Having turned on, as suggested, the power saving facility, it showed a life of some 18 hours plus. It actually lasted some 6 hours. Gremlins, me thinks.

Superslow mo is great, however it is sometimes alittle hard to try to focus on the object you want to take in superslow mo so sometimes is superslow to get working. Also it does not give any tutorial on bixby or hwo to use it so never really had a go as it all seems a bit messy and not very well htought through. Although overall it is a very powerful phone that can do some amazing stuff but some more tutorials would be helpful on how to use certian aspects and features otherwise there is no point having them!

My only gripe is battery, which unfortunately I feel will be a long time coming for a result. The phone is a processing monster but that eats power and if using in conjunction with Bluetooth devices then expect a day's worth of use. That aside I have to say it's a nice piece of kit

Plus points. Lovely camera. Nice and fast.
Minus points. Being all glass, it is far too slippery for one handed use/loose pockets. Comes fully loaded with a lot of unnecessary Samsung apps. The Bixby button is so annoying as it is next to the volume control buttons. Battery life is better than my existing 2 year old phone, but not much.

The quick start camera feature was better placed on the S6, I keep restarting my phone rather than starting the camera.

4 out of 5 stars.,"I have had the phone for about a week and I bought it mainly for the super slow motion feature. So far I am very disappointed with it. It seems to have trouble detecting movement and when it does it is literally one or two seconds before it reverts back to normal speed. When it does work it's pretty impressive but so far that's only been on one occasion when I tried it indoors. I'm hoping it's nothing more than my inexperience but none of my friends seem to be able to improve it either. The rest of the features are ok but the emoji feature is somewhat problematic too, in as much as I can't seem to access it once it's done. I'm hoping that once I'm used to it I will love it every bit as much, if not more than my beloved s3. I can't say yet whether I would recommend it to a friend, unfortunately.

The camera is brilliant quality, so much so the Mrs now takes about 20 extra pictures then she needs to make sure she can pick the best one.

5 out of 5 stars.,"I bought this phone 2 weeks ago having been an iPhone user for years and getting frustrated with the notoriously bad battery life. I have to say, over all, I'm pleased I made the switch.
The battery life is great. Despite my heavy usage of the phone, the battery generally lasts for most of the day. Such a nice change!
The camera on this phone is incredible. I love the clarity of the pictures and videos. I've not played around with all of the features yet, but can't wait to do so.
I know it's purely cosmetic, but I love the look and feel of this phone. I have the purple one and it's so pretty. It's almost a shame to put it in a case, but I want to protect my new toy to keep it attractive.
With the ability to set up a PIN, fingerprint scan, face recognition and iris recognition, the security on this phone seems incredible. I would recommend not using the iris scan if you wear glasses though and need the glasses to see the screen of your phone. The glare from glasses prevents the iris scanner from working.
The only thing that I feel let's this phone down is the inability to set different tones for different things. For example, I like to have one tone for texts, another for emails and another for app notifications (mainly so I know which I need to pay attention to and which I can ignore). This doesn't seem possible on this phone, which is shame.
The price is pretty high as well on this phone, but if you consider it against similar technology level phones on the market, it's definitely not the most expensive!
My final comment is regarding ease of use. I'm fairly tech savvy, so have been able to pick up the phone and start using it with some ease. Somebody who struggles with technology might find some of the features difficult to work out though.

Screen is not v responsive, often takes several goes to close apps or change from app to app. The switch from iPhone to Android via the app only copied about half the phone numbers and less than half of the apps. You need to reset up your profiles on each one.
Have disabled the Bixby button - very annoying everytime you're aiming for the volume.
Not the S9s fault but I listen to a lot of podcast and can't find a poddie app that works as well as the iPhone.

Now its so narrow its impossible to get a lot in a picture, even standing back a good distance away. The lighting is awful as well, where I could touch and adjust the back light on auto shots( not having to worry about other settings as well) I now can do this and would have o use Pro settings meaning its not just point and shoot.

4 out of 5 stars.,"I upgraded last month having owned an s6 Edge for over 2 years. I have to say the case itself looks and feels cheaper as more plastic than my old S6 Edge. Love the biometric security. I tried Samsung pay but had to use Google pay as my cards weren't supported. Mixed results with Bixby so jury is still out on that. The camera so far seems excellent with only one thing I miss, which is ability to take picture with main camera as well as a selfie into the same photo. Love the ability to rotate the home screen from portrait to landscape. That is one thing I really liked early on. Setup has so far been very straightforward and easy. There was only one thing I've had to research so far and that was when setting up the keyboard and switching predictive txt on, as it didn't work. I then found out you have to download the language pack even though its say UK language was installed. I was hoping the battery performance might have improved to the quality of certain competitors, but no luck on this side. However, charging is very quick. So far though, I'm very happy with the phone and was definitely the right choice for me.

5 out of 5 stars.,"Previously, I used to dislike my smart phone, I suffered several options before finally finding a Samsung Galaxy S6, Edge I really enjoyed this, and eventually moved onto a S7 Edge. I ran out my contract and finally moved into a 9 and still happy with all of the features I have available.
Pro - The Phone sleek design is gorgeous, and it is a shame that it needs to sit within a case. There are some great looking cases, but it still detracts from the design aspects.
Bixby is useful, but, some of the reasons I need to use Bixby are I can't get to the phone (such as in the car) but if an AUX lead is inserted, it seems to not pick up the voice. This could be improved
Very reactive/responsive features. The phone flicks between screens very quickly and there seems to be little or no delay between applications which is great.
I would've liked the colours to have had a bit more impact. Previous iterations (Sapphire Blue/Topaz Green) were gorgeous. The current Lilac and Coral are too bright, however as said above, always in a case, so it's less of an issue.

4 out of 5 stars.,"I have been using Samsung phones since 2014 when I obtained a Samsung Galaxy S5 on contract. Samsung'has been ahead of the curve for quite some time in terms of disability access, and the S9 continues this trend, with large fonts on menus and even in some apps now, you can scale the phone's UI in addition to adjusting the font size.
Typing it has to be said is a wee bit more difficult. Coming from the regular Galaxy S7 I am finding typing quite difficult with the S9's curved screen. I find myself inadvertantly pressing quite a lot of keys and the the slim form factor of the phone cuts into my palms somwhat meaning that they too can register as touches on the screen. II like how Samsung's kkeyboard now has a range of high contrast modes rather than just black characters on yellow keys, but I feel being able to select your own colours would be a favourable enhanmcement.
As for the camera, I find that it is excellent, yet I am finding it more difficult to achieve the crispness in photographs that was easily obtainable on the S7.

Not keen on the location of the finger print sensor either - right next to the camera lens on the back of the phone and I can see the lens getting dirty easily. On the plus side is the size of screen (no borders so the entire phone is usable) and the sound quality is excellent. Otherwise, my first Samsung disappointment and wished I hadn't given my excellent S7 to my wife!

4 out of 5 stars.,"So I gave 4 stars. Only reason that is, battery. At 3000mah and the power behind this phone it doesn't match up. Would like to see a Mophie case soon. I keep it on med battery saver and it can go 2 days with moderate use. Little over a full day with heavy use. If its left to it's own full potential, with full use, your looking at a half day to 3/4th. So my only gripe is the battery. Like I said, a Mophie case would be great, then there shouldn't be any issues with battery. The s9+ does offer 500mah more at 3500mah, but again, with 6 GB of ram and the power of the phone, cant see that making the plus run much longer, give or take 3-5 hours on max use. Having said all that now to the good stuff. The unboxing was awesome. I got the midnight black and it just looks so sexy to the eye. That Corning gorilla glass 5 is nice to the touch and makes the over all build sleek and easy to handle given its dimensions. The screen is amazing. I have had the phone about 3 weeks now and maintain at FHD. I haven't had use yet for uhd but if it's anything like the FHD I know I'll be impressed. Pictures and videos are so vivid and real, the added infinity screen just brings video and photo over the top. I have also been using both as standard, I have yet to play with any features which themselves are incredible enhancements. The sound. It's just stupid incredible, must be heard to believe. Simple as that. UI is simple. The added advanced features get some getting use to but once intermediate level is achieved the phone becomes far more advanced than you can imagine. This review is after 3 weeks and using it on its standard level. I am getting to specials now so I will make a review about that soon enough. But so far this phone is unmatched. My friend at work has the iPhone x and we compare every day and the Galaxy wins every time. More reviews to come. Starting out though. Its incredible. I'm very pleased and look forward to accessorizing this to the T.

Even though I've turned off bixby, it randomly just opens, which is annoying. It also doesn't seem to like my WiFi, so nothing loads when it's connected, which is odd.

4 out of 5 stars.,"I've been buying Samsung phones since 2012 and I'm always very happy with them and so far the S9 lives up to my expectations. Instead of having to wait in the store while the sales person transfer anything you now are able to do it at home on your own time and the start up was very easy. I especially like the new feature of the edge so instead of having multiple screens for the apps I just have that 1 little sidebar that's hidden. I also like the ability now to leave my phone unlocked in ""trusted"" places which is nice when I'm home. My one complaint, and it seems small but that's a pretty big to me is you can't individualized text message alerts for people so I can't tell right away if it's my mom or my crazy ex boyfriend texting me. Please bring back this feature on the next update.

I am actually a camera addict that's why I really loved it, especially the AR Emojis! My friends also love it when I use it while I'm taking a video and singing my favorite songs for my hubby. I can actually use it all day without charging. There was a time when it logs but its pretty fine, you just have to wait a second or 3. Overall I really love it.

On the downside the charging port is now different to the S7 which made any extras such as the Samsung vr gear now incompatible, thank you Samsung I was genuinely disappointed that I have to replace this!! On the upside the handset feels better in your hand and the screen has no annoying buttons anymore.

4 out of 5 stars.,"The phone is brilliant, dont get me wrong, everything about the phone screams quality and performance, but the software still isnt on par with the offerings from other major brands. Alot of features are handy, nifty and very cool but others seem useless and Im not sure how or when I would ever use them, game mode for example can lock the screen on an app, which is clever in principlw but in reality it means that in order to play the game, the screen must then be unlocked from game mode and back into normal mode... And Bixby, oh boy. Bixby is trying to be on the same level as alexa or siri but theyre just not on the same par, bixby is still somewhat primitive and slow to load, which happens an awful lot thanks to the placement of the ""Bixby button"". Placing a button used by so few directly underneath the volume rockers was definetely the poorest design move throughout the entire phone. Even just the possiblity to remap the button would be greatly appreciated, as of right now, to do so requires extra apps and software, to be connected to a computer and a little bit of coding, there must be an easier way

The battery does not hold it for a whole day, the full-screen experience is something what I cannot enjoy because I must have a cover on the phone all the time -since I know (from expreience with S6 edge) how expensive to repair the broken screen. All together I'm happy with the phone and I will keep it , but if there will be a new phone with lasting battery, and an unbreakable screen from any manufacturer I will definitely switch to that.

Bixby is very new to me and is hard to get used to (especially with the left side button) All I've used it for at the moment is to turn on the flashlight. But watching some videos on it I'm sure there's plenty it can do. With the S7 Edge I had some issues with the edge of the screen when watching videos or playing games where my finger would touch the sides and throw me onto the edge panel of even change the video I'm watching. With the S9 I no longer have that problem. Overall 4 stars. I'm still a Samsung fan. Well done.

Particularly freedom to use the phone how you like with unlimited customisation. The phone itself feels very well built, easily as good quality as Apple's offerings- one thing that put me off android in the past was the cheaper feel some handsets had. I do have one small request though, I don't use bixby, at all.. I'd like the option to have the bixby button remappable to something like the camera or silent mode.

And there's not much going on inside besides the annual processor upgrade. The new camera doesn't even seem to jump out massively for me. I upgraded from an S7 Edge and I don't feel I've gained more. The phone is really fast though and it remains a really nice slick experience. Also glad to have stereo speakers on a phone. But overall, it's hard to justify as an upgrade if you have an S6 onwards.

5 out of 5 stars.,"omg. where do i start??!! the s9 is packed with the best features that any phone can provide. it is more than i expected. the features such as Bixby, the camera quality (it even has a cam for food pics), pic filters, resolution, and wwwwwwwww the speakers on this phone are amazing. they are atmosphere Dolby. so you can play anything on this phone and it will make the sounds kind of hug your ears and surround sound. i played music via my phone with an aux cable in the car and even the sound in the car sounded different, it was more bass to it and just incredible.
i could honesty say that i thought i could never move away from apple iPhones, because apple is very controlling. their products are as such that not all devices and gates on the market are compatible with apple. they want you to buy from them and i hate that, it limits everything to a high price and limited products only sold by apple. i was in a dilema becasue i have all my backup on iPhone. the iPhone features are very limited compared to the samsung s9. the samsung is beautiful and every feature of it is worth the price of the phone. i will never go back to iPhone. they are over priced and have constantly come up with boring products. andriod is the only way forward for me. i am so glad i am out of the apple eco system. they made the system so that everyone with apple now cannot move on to android easily which i think is very bad sales strategy to make cosumers totally reliant on a certain products and not being free to use sd cards or having to buy extra products just to use the phone properly such as air pods and split chargers.
i have a youtube channel on which i will be reviewing my galaxy s9 and many other products i come across from galaxy very soon. i cannot wait to explore with galaxy. my passion is to try new products and buy everythign possible supporting the phone from the same company.

I really need to be able to glance at my phone when notifications arrive. Sadly the screen does not auto wake which means I have to physically pick the phone up all day long, I waste a lot of my day trying to wake up my phone. Very frustrating. I'd also like to customise how the notifications appear, say ungrouped and more or less detail. Again, can't be done sadly.

I want a phone that I can completely customise right down to the contacts and their text message notification. Which is something that I could do on my edge. Instead I am stuck with chosing one of your silly notification tones for everyone. Now I have to look at my phone to see if it's a text from my husband, my boss or a Twitter notification. Please sort this out and the phone will then have 5 stars. Camera is great, I used it in very low light and it was like recording in the day time. Battery is ok but then it's new.

5 out of 5 stars.,"Having had a Samsung Galaxy S6, there was no doubting that I would again upgrade to another Samsung smart phone. Transfering data from my S6 to the S9 was incredibly easy using the transfer function. Having had the S9 for over a month now, there is however several features that are missing on it. On the S6, the home button allowed quick access to the phone whereas the S9 requires to double tap the main screen and then the unlock swipe or even using the power button. This button feature on the S6 also allowed a double tap to instantly access the camera feature one which I really miss on the S9.
With regards to the camera, there also various forms or editing missing like sketch this I used regurarly on the S6. Using these editing modes also isnt as easy on the S9 but that is just minor. Minor things regarding the camera also bug me with the super slow-mo feature being a bit awkard in how its used and rarely takes a bright image inside. The main camera however is good and is an upgrade from the S6. This I would say would be on an image quality with a DSLR and I reguraly use the pictures for report writing due to their quality.
In relation to the pre installed apps on the S9, I got rid of around 70% of these straight away as I will never use them. These are the likes of Facebook, twitter, snapchat, etc. There are a few others that are refusing to leave so I am stuck with them.
Bixby I will be honest, I have not used yet but as you probably have guess now that Ibhave deleted most of the apps, my phone is a work phone and not something to pass time with.
The battery on this is flipping brillant and even under heavy use only requires charging every 2-3days. It is super quick to charge even from empty. I like the way the home screens are laid out and I find this easier to browse through than my much loved S6 as well as finding icons. Adding contacts to these home screens is much easier.
The time on constantly is also a nice feature. At the start the phone went into thsi mode within seconds of setting it down which was annoying but this is was easily changed.
Overall the phone is excellent. It is easy to use however without the case for it at the start it was slightly harder to hold given its slim design.

✘ No, I do not recommend this product.

2 out of 5 stars.,"I was so excited to get this phone, I have had Samsungs for years, the S4, followed by the S7 Edge and now the S9 so to say I was keen to get home and see what was in the box was an understatement and I wasn't disappointed.
It looks good, the screen and resolution and quality of it all is very good, exactly what you would expect from a flagship phone of one of the leading companies in technology and mobile devices.
However, once I started to use the phone, a few glitches became apparent and the longer I have had the phone, the more these glitches have become huge issues for the usability and my happiness with the phone.
First of all- phone calls. They just end mid way through for no rhyme or reason, sometimes 2 minutes into a conversation, sometimes 25 minutes in and sometimes multiple times. I thought this was signal or other people's phone at first but I then checked signal and had full and it was happening in places I had never had problems with signal before.So I thought it was the other person's phone, until it happened with all different people.
Next issue is dead patches in the phone calls, if it's not cutting you off and ending the call, you will be speaking to someone and there will be huge dead patches where neither of you can hear one another and everything has to be repeated before the next dead patch.
Next is battery, I had the S7 Edge before the S9 and the battery was alright, it would last me a day at least....now the battery last half a day if I am lucky and I am having to put it on charge way before I go to bed as it's critcal battery again- so that's twice a day it needs charging which is ridiculous!
Finally- Some things just haven't been thought through properly...screen shots for example, you use the lock key and between the up and down volume key. It is impossible to hit this! Every screen shot I take has my ringer volume at the top as it's impossible to land it right 98% of the time. It's so stupid plus it takes my phone off silent everytime!
Overall, I was super excited and wanted to love this phone as I love technology and love Samsung but I have been super disappointed and let down by the S9 and for the first time ever, have actually considered moving to a competitor and regretted getting this phone.
✘ No, I do not recommend this product.

While I am still learning the new phone, one thing I absolutely HATE about it is that you can't set custom text message notifications for your contacts. That's very important for me to have, enough so that if Samsung doesn't update the software and add that option soon, I will be returning this phone and going with an iPhone. I have never had one, only had Galaxy, but this option is a must for me. I need to know who is texting without dropping everything I am doing to look at the phone. Samsung PLEASE put this option back. It's ridiculous that you took it off. I know I can download another messaging app in order to have custom notifications, but I shouldn't have to do that. It was an option before and should be one now!!!! Please fix it, then I will leave a better review.

4 out of 5 stars.,"Just upgraded from S6 after 2 years due to performance issues. Pros: Awesome camera with cool features even in the dark! Size is similar to S6 so not wide. Usage of full screen is great esp for watching videos. Like the pull down options menu and the pull up apps menu Voice recognition works perfectly for me, especially in my texting app. Battery life is as expected for my usage. No better or worse than the S6. Speaker and microphone are top notch. Callers don't even know they're on speaker phone until they hear background noise. Charging cable plugs in the first time, every time. Like the edge tab. Very convenient. Was easy to transfer ALL my data and settings to new phone with included adapter. Can increase storage space with optional sd card. S6 didn't have that option. More settings to turn things on and off. I can turn off almost everything I don't like.
Cons: Wasn't happy about buying all new charging cables but I had to buy a new case too so I guess it comes with upgrading. Didn't cost enough to complain about really but still a con. Hate the curved screen. Makes me want my S6 back! I hate it because pressing on a link, letter, box and so forth is difficult if it is too close to the curve. You have to manipulate the screen or turn your phone sideways to succeed. I cant exit my pop up texts easily because of this design flaw. It ""complicates"" things. For me, this is its major downfall. (4 star vs 5) The onscreen apps, home key, back button menu takes getting used to. I'm still not used to it. I've almost accidentally deleted emails or pictures because the back button is conveniently located directly under the delete button in both of these apps. Both are Samsung apps. Haven't used the iris scanner or finger print scanner. Bixby is a pain. I don't need nor do I want all the reminders and hints. Is there a way to uninstall it? I like to do things myself. Overall, Awesome phone. I'm still finding cool things it does after almost a month.
+ Pros: Bright display, Realistic color, Durable, Lightweight, Built-in speakers
- Cons: curved screen
✔ Yes, I recommend this product.

4 out of 5 stars.,"Bought recently because my Windows phone had reached the end of it's life. I've already got other Android devices so it seemed like a logical step.
Jeez, some of the stuff that you take for granted needs a third party app to work as you'd expect it to whilst stuff that's installed seems so ridiculous you wonder how much advertising revenue they are getting!
Bixby is a waste of time and system resources, the bixby button is just in the right place that when you squeeze the phone to switch it on one handed you get the partially deaf, totally useless assistant popping up t tell you what a wonderful sunny day it is when looking out of the window shows you that it's tipping down with rain.
Always on display? What happened to a simple clock that wakes up when you touch the screen - no what we need is a stupidly over complicated thing that eats batteries if you leave it 'always on'
Battery life? If you want to really use all of the features, have a bright screen at full resolution and are a heavy user of the device your battery will be dead in a few hours - without a charging mat or a car charger it will not get through the day unless you go for some serious battery saving measures - worth bearing in mind if you spend a lot of time away from your desk. A mobile phone needs to be mobile and the S9 needs too much charging to make it useful.
Overall? It's a good phone if you accept it's limitations.
Am I happy that I bought it? Yes because it does stuff that I need it to do and it's fast and stable.
Would I recommend it to anybody else? That would depend on who they were and how they used a phone

The positives:- - Had a great deal - Love the dual sim - Flexibility of dual apps - Great camera. - Good battery life
The negatives:- - Very disappointed with the slow mo camera - Its very poor if the lighting is not really bright. Cant even get it to work in my living room, which isn't that dark!! My iPhone SE did a much better job. - A little heavy - The Spotify feature does not allow me to EDIT the order of playlists. As a fitness class instructor this was a key tool when organising playlists. Looking at online research I need to plug it in to PC to do this - Its all bit of a fuss for such a small request. - May have previously downloaded a strange app on the phone which caused LOTS of advertising pop ups. The only way around to get rid of this was restore factory settings and start again.... In my 10 years with iPhone I never had a pop up problem. I am not sure if I full recommended it.. I would say yes so long as you don't use certain features on spotify or slow mo cameras...

I'm also a little disappointed that a phone of this calibre does not have the ability to switch itself on when the alarm goes off like my previous non Samsung phone did. The most disappointing thing about the S9 is that it's basically the S8 with a better camera.

I've two dogs and the slow motion and super slow mo are amazing and hilarious :D The only downside to the phone is that although the screen looks lovely, it's a huge pain in the behind as the device is so slim there's literally nothing to hold on to and I've already managed to crack the back when it literally slid out of my hand :( playing games is also difficult sometimes as part of my palm has touched the screen and it wouldn't register what my fingers were doing properly.

4 out of 5 stars.,"I received my S9 last week and overall it looks and feels great. I had a Samsung S6 previously and I appreciate the new features. Smart Select is so far my favourite feature given that it's not invasive on the screen and highly customisable. Overall I am happy with the purchase however there are few things I do not like. For example the inability to re-map the Bixby button to something else. I generally do not use voice interfaces and I would benefit from being able to map the Bixby button to something else. I also do not like the buttons toolbar at the bottom of the screen (apps, menu and back buttons) I find it very frustrating to have to keep locking/unlocking the button bar based on the app I use - I hope this gets better with future updates

1 out of 5 stars.,"Whilst many manufacturers and designers strive to add value add features to retain customers (and add more) I was incredibly surprised to find that the ACR (automatic call record) app that I use extensively in business will not now function on the S9. I've had an S3,S4,S5,S6 all which worked perfectly, now the Samsung S9 wont support this. This was one of the prominent capabilities I purchase Samsung Android phones, and just can't understand in a world of adding functionality, this has been ""removed"" or locked out on capability. Samsung, I'm very disappointed. Has me now considering having two phones (using an older one in support) which is just nuts when ""upgrading"". Would not recommend Samsung S9 until this is fixed. Confirmed as a Samsung issue, not an app developer problem (well documented on web searches). Poor score as a result.

My only critique is that the emojis could've been upgraded to showcase the diverse customer base Samsung has....are we all yellow?? If it's competing with Apple, it's loosing there...same for the self-emoji. Being a black woman with curly hair, my emoji looks NOTHING like me. I doubt I'll use that feature since it is supposed to be custom to reflect the user of the phone...right? Maybe I lost the point of that feature, but it's not relevant to me until it actually has more options to look like me.

All the complaints I had with S8 on S9 are addressed, for the first time the speakers are fairly good. Touchwiz is the only downside which is cumbersome and ""cartoonist"". It has improved vastly but the theming and customisation is very limited and has poor options. This is the major reason for it not being as popular as it should be. If more flatter and more ""iOS"" type of themes were available then it would be the best. This would appeal to more people. Fix your ui make it more iOS type smoothness and seamless.

5 out of 5 stars.,"I bought this last week being an iPhone user since 2012 and young through there various models. My last phone was an iPhone 6s which is still a great phone but camera was becoming dated. I wanted a new phone with a better camera, customisable storage and bigger screen. The newer iPhones would have given me this but I could not stand the fact they took away the the auxillary connection. I want the option of wireless and wired and buying a new iPhone would have taken that option away and forcing me to another option. I have a great sound system that I connect to in the kitchen whereby I can watch sky sports with the aux connection. I decided to look around and started to feel myself looking at the s9 even more. I made the transition and after a couple of days of adjusting I must say I really like the phone. I love the camera, the speakers and more importantly the size. Has great features like optimisation and lookout. I love this phone and have not looked back. The one feature I would like to change is the way WhatsApp pictures go into the gallery. On the iPhone it is self contained in the app even though it uses your memory. Other than that I love this phone!!

But the quality of the screen in far advanced to the S7 edge. I cant explain it but the slightly smaller screen is nicer and easier to use. The speed of all the updated apps is incredibly quick. I love the finger print scanner and Heart beat monitor. It has encouraged me to also take my blood pressure. I think this could potentially save my life at some point.

Facebook should not come as a system app and users should be able to install and uninstall it as they please not just 'disable' the fact that Facebook comes installed is ridiculous. Also when you turn the volume down all the way it goes into vibrate mode, I feel it would be a nice touch to be able to press down on volume one more time and have it enter silent mode without vibrations. This is how my old nexus 5x worked and I miss that capability because vibrate is annoying so I have had to switch it completely off all together instead of being able to toggle it easily.

Within 10 minutes of transferring my phone numbers, and the rest of my information, I went to the home screen, and I was pleasantly surprised to see my mum looking back at me. The phone itself is just amazing, within 20 minutes I had everything I needed to get talking to my friends and other contacts, the screen is very clear, the keyboard is nicely spaced out for my clumsy fingers, even my location, and weather forecast is very clearly displayed without unlocking the phone. The Bluetooth function was easy to pair with my headphones, so I can listen to my music, or audible books, more importantly talk to people hands free while driving.

The camera, just on the automatic setting, is incredible. It alters lighting but only adjusts it to look natural...but better! Zoom is excellent - both when taking and when you've taken a photo. Selfie panorma is good.
I don't really rate the selfie emoji feature - bit pointless.
The keyboard isn't as accurate when typing resulting in so many typos and not as sensitive as it could be.
Battery life is fantastic - I don't need to charge my phone during the day despite constantly using it (much better than the S7 - I never owned an S8 to compare).
I like the edge menu and the dofferent option for screenshots.
I don't find Bixby any easier than doing things myself, same with Google assistant to be honest.
I like the soft buttons. Biometric security is excellent.
Transfering everything from my old phone was easy and quick - exactly as it was on my old phone. So good!
I bought a Samsung wireless charger but sadly it didn't charge through my plastic phone case so I had to return it.
Storage space is fantastic and the phone continually 'cleans' itself, with no interference in me using it.
The dual speakers quality and location is fab.
The phone materials are excellent - very professional looking and you feel like you're holding a quality product. I have a cover on it because I'm clumsy - shame as the blue colour and whole item is so sleek and gorgeous.

The phone it’s self is to similar to the S8 which is also a better price per month and upfront cost. Samsung are usually known for innovation and bringing something different to the market but they completely haven’t changed much on the new flagship. Notifications are annoying if you clear all notifications from the drop down it removed the dot from the actual app so if you don’t remember you will build up messages or notifications etc. Just clearing from the drop down should still leave the dot on the actual app itself. Out of 10 I would give it a 7. Overly priced S9 in a S8’s clothing.

5 out of 5 stars.,"I have had the phone over a week now. Upgrade from the S8. I was a little disappointed at first as there was next to no difference over the S8. It even looks near enough identical to the S8. It does seem to take better pictures and seems to operate a slightly faster. I don't know if this is just me hoping to notice the changes. I still have the S8 and could compare the two. I don't fully get Bixby. I gave it a shot but found that it's bizarre to use. The internet search answers that it gives are no where near as good or as accurate as ok Google. Unfortunately I have gone back to using that. I think Bixby needs a lot more development. This sounds a very negative account of the S9. I would say I had the S7 before the S8. I preferred the size of the S7 if I am honest. But if you're going from an S7 or previous model then the upgrade would be fantastic and a big, noticeable, step up. The S8, however, is a fantastic phone anyway but in all honesty the S9 doesn't progress enough to warrant upgrading from the S8.

3 out of 5 stars.,"This phone is great in many ways. The new camera technology is a huge improvement. Huawei can throw in 100mp camera into their phones and it still won't be a competitor. The stereo speakers sounds beautiful. The main gripe I have is with the design of the phone, don't get me wrong it's an attractive design that feels good in the hand. What I can't understand is why the phone is so much heavier and thicker than the S8? It has the same 3000 mah battery! Even the S7 Edge has a 3600 mah battery and weighs less than S9, while keeping that sexy sleek thin design that I love. For me that is a deal breaker because it doesn't feel as comfortable to hold, especially once you put a case on. Another thing I'm not so pleased with is, what's up with the extra long phone? No real point to have a long screen, we will be scrolling down or up either way lol and that gives us that weird 18:9 ratio. I feel like Samsung did the best job on the S6 edge when it comes to overall specifications of the design with it being much lighter, thinner, etc.. but if that stuff doesn't bother you as it did for me by all means this is the best phone to buy on the market right now and you should buy it.

Not Many issues, although I have noticed when on a call the proximity sensor can be a bit temperamental as the screen can turn off and on quickly when you lift the phone away to use the key pad. Media volume is lower than the S8, I have found I often need to turn it up to full to hear some videos. Overall the phone is brilliant, by far the best available today.

My husband has the Note 8 and is of the same opinion,especially when a 4 year old is playing games or using any apps. I miss it so much that I am considering changing to iPhone or at the very least going back to a more basic model like my old Samsung Galaxy S6!

Just like an s8 with a few extra gimics that you will use once. Nothing is straight forward about a Samsung and there are still some things that are stumping my friends and I for hours even though they all have Samsung's too. The screen is nice and clear and I have enjoyed using the heart rate monitor.

5 out of 5 stars.,"I did pre-order and Samsung delivered the phone on time. It was very quick to transfer files from old phone to Samsung S9. After using the phone for a week now, I can tell this is my best phone by far. The image results are pretty sharp even in the low light condition. As for indoor pictures, I used the camera's flash and the result is pretty good. The app works awesomely too - I use Samsung Health Management app on daily basis, and so far so good, I use Samsung app to record my sport activities and heart measurement (by placing your fingers on the sensors). I haven't checked how the sensor works on stress level though. The speaker is great and very clear. Lastly, of course, the design is smart, flashy and charming. My previous phone was Samsung edge and I adore the design of Samsung edge, I am glad the Samsung S9 has the smart edge design as well, only this time is way better looking - less wider. Plus, I like the Always on Display Option - a fast way to check the phone without sliding it.

5 out of 5 stars.,"Coming from the S7, this was a leap forward with a larger screen, faster everything, larger/better/ brighter display, powerful features. Samsung made it easy to transfer everything I chose to transfer from the old phone. The S9 uses a USB-C connection so I'm having to order new charging cables for car and work. The S7 charger works though, just not the cables. The sound on the S9 has greatly improved. Can actually hear things in music that I never could on the S7 via speakers. The only issues I've come across thus far is the ability to assign a specific SMS tone to certain individuals. So far, all I see is the ability to set a ringtone and the default notification tone is always used for SMS. Got the phone yesterday. Woke up this morning and it had a software update waiting. Samsung is a step ahead. Using this on Verizon. Just swapped SIM from old S7 to the S9 and worked like a charm.
