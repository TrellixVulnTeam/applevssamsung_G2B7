influenster,iphone,"Pros: This is easily the most outstanding gadget I have ever owned. I was dreading losing the home button and having a smaller phone in my hand but my wife√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 6s Plus now seems like it was from a different era. The Face ID, 3D Touch, Swipe System and Touch to Open all work like a dream, meaning I can whizz around the phone with minimal thought and effort. The size is perfect, after loving the larger Plus series I now realise the X is better balanced for me without reverting to a smaller screen. I love being able to swipe between open apps without having to manoeuvre my thumb up and down the screen, meaning, with my poor memory, if I wanted to write down something from, say, the calculator into notes I can do so easily with a flick of my thumb. The wireless charging is outstanding, so much so, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve bought chargers for my bedroom and my lounge and hope I never have to go back to plugging the cable in again. The screen is absolutely stunning. Watching videos and looking at photographs is a pleasure and, in all honesty, makes me want to watch more which I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never bothered with before on a phone. The camera also seems much better but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve not had chance to experiment yet as it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s something I need to learn more about. Overall, I was worried about taking a punt on the X but I know now that if I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d not upgraded (as was my plan) or gone with the 8 Plus, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d be pretty gutted right now. Apple has managed to reignite my love of the smart phone again with the most perfect bit of kit I could have imagined. Thank you!Cons: The cost is absolutely crippling for people like me. Luckily I got a fair forces discount (20%) on the contract price which brought it into my range, though still massively top end. The only other problem I have is the reachability function. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s something I use often but struggle to get right on the X, especially when there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s something to activate right where my thumb will be when I attempt to swipe down. I dare say, without my wireless charger next to my chair, the battery could be an issue as I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a heavy user of the phone, so I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say either way with certainty at the moment.",5
influenster,iphone,"This was a very nice upgrade from my iPhone 7. I do miss the home button at times but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been a week and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve gotten used this phone. I love how it scans your face to unlock your phone, that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s actually pretty dope! The camera quality is so much better than my old phone which is nice since I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m big on photography. I gave it a 4 starts because for some odd reason the camera in my Snapchat is extremely zoomed in and I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fix it. I read online they are working on an upgrade for Snapchat so that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not so zoomed in. Other than that I love this phone. #newphonewhodis",4
influenster,iphone,"This is technically for the iPhone XR, since I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seem to create a review for that specific product. I LOVE the iPhone XR. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a great compromise between quality and value (I did not want a phone that retailed for 1k+). Performance is fantastic. Excellent battery life. Every once in a great while, the touch screen is slightly non-responsive, but it corrects itself pretty quickly when that happens. The camera is excellent, though not as amazing as everyone makes it out to be. Definitely recommend this phone.",5
influenster,iphone,"I was skeptical about getting this new phone. I love Apple. I love the iPhone. I just didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know about upgrading to a new version of it.√∞≈∏Àú‚Äö I am stuck in my ways. But, I love this phone. It took a bit to get used to. Not having the home button and the new way of screenshooting. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s actually a good change. It was worth it. Not bigger that the iPhone 6 really. Just there is more screen room so it seems way bigger. I am happy I took the step. I would recommend it.",5
influenster,iphone,I have the iPhone XS Max and I absolutely love it. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s expensive very but I think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s worth the price esp for the camera and I take a lot of photos. This phone absolutely meets every expectation I expected of it. I would recommend an apple phone to anyone or any apple device I have never had any problems with apple and I have had every apple phone since the 3GS. Love love love apple!,5
influenster,iphone,"I love my iphone X, its sleek, stylish, great display(OLED), always fast. I recommend this over the Xs since its only $900 if you can still find them at non apple retailers since Apple officially discontinued this model due to the fact that they want to sell the Xs'.",5
influenster,iphone,"I absolutely love this phone. I love that it takes love pictures so if someone or something suddenly moves, you can go back in the moment of taking the picture to chose where the person or thing was in the picture. I have dropped my phone in the toilet (I know yuck) while doing my makeup and got it out and have had absolutely no problems with it.",5
influenster,iphone,"Its great I love it its so different,special and stunning its really cool,especially the face locksrceen even though its little expensive it deserves every buck i put in it totally recommended and one of the best features is the 3d talking people really cool really special I would totally recommend it to others",5
influenster,iphone,"I like my phone, it is fast and I like the screen on it. However, I think that it is too expensive for what it does. I honestly just really like the face recognition because you don't need to keep typing in your password but overall I think that's what I paid for. The camera could be better and so can the resolution.",4
influenster,iphone,I love my iPhone X. Granted it is not much different than the 9 but it does have a few perks to it. I like the sleep look of the phone and I love IOS!! It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s easy to use and the sleek design is very appealing. I have been using the iPhone since the very first one. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a dedicated iPhone fan!!,5
influenster,iphone,"I love a phone that fits in my small hands and I never upgrade to just get the new best thing. So this was a first...I upgraded just to upgrade. I am not disappointed. The facial recognition is intuitive and fast, camera is upgraded with amazing portrait options and 4K video is a reality. I am just getting into the features but if you are charging me 1200 for a phone, when I could buy a new laptop, it had better live up to expectations and then go beyond. So far my fav feature is the enlarged screen and intuitive lighting. Believe it or not, I can now browse my phone as it dims itself when putting the baby to bed without him getting distracted. Mom win!",4
influenster,iphone,So I have had my iPhone X for about a year now and I love it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it has its flaws. Like when I broke my phone a few months back and It kept calling 911 because when it broke it messed something up with the side button. I kinda feel like the power button being able to do that is a no go.,5
influenster,iphone,"When this came out, my husband and I got this on the sale deal. I upgraded from a iPhone 7 to this. I love this phone. It has an amazing camera. I love the way it fits into my hands. I definitely recommend purchasing this phone if you‚Äôre an iPhone lover.",5
influenster,iphone,"I was a Samsung Galaxy Android user, my daughter on the other hand loved üì± I tried it at one time and just hated it, after using the android and not having that home button it made it easier for me to swipe and get where I needed to be. Now this IPHONE X has completely won me overüíØüî•üçé by far the iPhone X is the best phone I‚Äôve ever used!! There is still so much I have to learn but the camera is simply amazing and A11 Bionic chip just put this phone in a league of its own. For those of you that are use to the home button it‚Äôs my understanding that the IPhone 8 and 8plus has the A11 Bionic chip along with the home button your use to!! I highly recommend this phone to either user the X is now very adaptable for the android user!",5
influenster,iphone,I absolutely love this phone!! From all the features to the color of my phone. The price is high but worth every penny. It‚Äôs very reliable I‚Äôve yet to have a dropped call. And this phone doesn‚Äôt damage easily. I highly recommend this phone to users!!,5
influenster,iphone,"Upon first receiving I figured ... wow what another waste of money! However, the phone has since grown on me. I love the headphone update and the glass design. You will need to be careful and have a durable case because if you drop it, it‚Äôs going to crack on either side. The no home button addition was quite annoying at first, but I gave since become more acquainted with it. Once you learn all the tricks and get used to the gestures and motions, this phone is so much more awesome and so high tech. One thing that surely annoys me is the Face ID. It does not always work well, especially when laying down.  My favorite feature is the Animoji and the Portrait Mode. You can basically have a legit photoshoot with your phone.",5
influenster,iphone,"I have had the X since last November and so far have been pretty pleased with it. I love that they redesigned the exterior without a home button or that extraneous space above and below the screen. Also, love the face recognition feature (although there are times that it does not work that well). The swiping feature is super cool and so much easier and more streamlined than before. I really didn't notice a big change in the camera capability, the picture look good but not that much different from the previous I phone. Last weekend my screen suddenly stopped working for no reason. Apple was great though and replaced it at no cost as it was under warranty. Great model, would recommend!",4
influenster,iphone,I‚Äôd love to get the IPhone X for the holidays! I have always been Team I phone for the longest time. I have the iPhone 6S and of course would like to upgrade to the iPhone X. I‚Äôve heard nothing but great stuff about the new phone. My best friend has it and raves about it all the time. It‚Äôll definitely be a step up from the iPhone I currently have! Fingers crossed I get it these coming up holidays!! Hehe :)Apple iPhone X,5
influenster,iphone,I went from an IPhone 6s Plus to this phone. My iPhone 6s battery stopped keeping its charge. I really love the size of this phone and the fact that I still have a nice size screen. The phone is slim to fit in your pocket but you don‚Äôt feel like you are struggling to push the buttons on the keyboard. I do not miss the fact that there is no home screen button. I had to get use to using the lock button and the up volume button for screen shots. The only thing I‚Äôm not impressed with is that at night the facial recognition has a hard time and you have to punch in your code in order to unlock your phone. Overall I‚Äôm very happy with this phone.,4
influenster,iphone,I really like my iPhone X. I got it right when it came out and it had some glitches especially in the cold but as more updates come out the better it is working. My favorite feature it the portrait mode. It really makes all my pictures look nice. Some apps are sticky to use since some buttons are in the cut out of where the camera is out. But with more updates the better the phone is getting. The picture I have below I did not edit just used one of the portrait mode options to take. Apple iPhone X,4

influenster,iphone,"I‚Äôve had the opportunity to use the X & it is by far one of the best devices on the market.  The price tag is a bit much, just like all apple devices but it‚Äôs features are outstanding. I recommend this device to anyone.",5
influenster,iphone,This is a great product. The iPhone X has a great display and is known for it‚Äôs full screen and Face ID. The problem is that there is a notch that bothers everyone. But honestly I don‚Äôt have a problem. It‚Äôs price is $1000-1500. Which is a little expensive. The iOS 11 has been a problem for the iPhone X but with iOS 12 coming out there should be a lot a bug fixes. But other than that great phone. And great for games and Animoji.,5
influenster,iphone,im so happy i upgraded from my iphone 6 to the iphone x the design is so sleek and looks amazing the camera quality is breathtaking and the size is perfect i don‚Äôt think a phone can get better than this,5
influenster,iphone,"The X is simply breathtaking. It is a break from the iPhones that we have become used to, with new gestures, features, etc. The X is FAST and the touch screen is silky smooth. On paper the 8 and X do not look that different but touch and feel wise there is a difference. The camera on the X is simply amazing with built-in optical image stabilization on both camera/focal lengths. The detail is crisp and sharp. This truly rivals a DLSR camera. Music play on the X is better also, maybe its the sexiness of the phone but it is louder.",5
influenster,iphone,"This phone is really great. I took the leap and upgraded from an LG G Stylo 5.7"" Android Smartphone - Boost Mobile and this phone is SO much better. I love the camera and the portrait mode. I‚Äôm into photography so the camera is amazing. I also love how durable the phone is. I‚Äôm very clumsy and it‚Äôs been very reliable. Yes, the price is expensive but it is worth it. Here‚Äôs a photo I took on the iPhone X.",5
influenster,iphone,I love my new phone! The battery is much better than other phones. I love the colors and size of the phones. They are a little pricey but most phones are. Definitely met my expectations.,5
influenster,iphone,"I used to be an android user and then a few years ago I switched to Apple and never looked back. This has been my favorite phone ever. The portrait mode makes it super fun to take pictures of my little boys (and, lets be honest, cats). I listen to hours of podcasts every week and the sound clarity is perfect. This phone is FAST. The facial recognition has made my life immensely more easy. I recommend this to everyone. If you‚Äôre considering it- just take the plunge. It‚Äôs worth it! OH! Get a really good phone protector.",5
influenster,iphone,"Ah... the iPhone X. One of the most popular phones currently out on the market. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt say it would fall under the affordable column, it‚Äôs really expensive! (Almost so expensive that it‚Äôs not worth getting). However, the display of the phone is gorgeous- so glad Apple finally got rid of those huge bezels, they finally released a phone that looks similar to its current competitors. The camera quality is insane on this phone- don‚Äôt  even get me started on portrait mode, it‚Äôs amazing!",4
influenster,iphone,"This iPhone is the perfect size! Slim with a larger screen than the 6,7, or 8. The phone can be found at any Apple Store or on apple's online website. It has an amazing camera including the selfie mode. We heavily rely on our phones and they make our lives so much easier by reminding us of what needs to be done, setting our alarms for us, & allowing us to put important events on our calendars. It also saves and captures our beautiful memories. This phone provides more security features such as face recognition which is much needed. I would love this for Christmas! This is my #GiftCrush #Influenster #WishesCanComeTrue #OnTheNiceList Apple iPhone X",5
influenster,iphone,Ok here is the skinny!!! Love the phone. I leaped from the 7+ to the iPhone X. I do miss the larger size. The X size is in-between the 8 and 8+ size. the phone is also narrower than the plus sizes. But the new design is gorgeous and sleek and will be costly in repairs if dropped. It will take some getting used to because the home screen is no longer there but change is good and i am sure every purchaser will get use to it but if ¬†you can't live without the home button there is ¬†the option for ¬†8 and 8+ which is similar except for face ID and the changes to the front camera for selfy and the anemoji which are fun. the notch at the top as some what bother some at first but now i don't care about it. The X is fast and i am sure overtime with software update will get even more advanced and better.,5
influenster,iphone,I want this phone I would love to upgrade from 8 plus but sadly it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a little to high for me to get but who knows someday lords will I might get to try one or have one,5
influenster,iphone,"So worth the money! I recently started a blog and needed and new phone and camera. We just went with the iphone X and it takes amazing photos! It's¬† super fast and the user interface is only slightly different from the others. You'll get used to it in no time. I really love the face ID feature too. I was very skeptical about it, but now I love using it to log into my bank account and make purchases. I feel more secure.",5
influenster,iphone,I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand what all the hype is about. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re paying 1000 dollars just to get some emojis that imitate you and Face ID which honestly sucks because half the time it can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even recognize you and you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even switch it to Touch ID because they removed that option. I guess Apple is all about one or the other. Also it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a headphone jack which I hate. What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the purpose of removing a headphone jack? I find it to be a stupid decision.,2
influenster,iphone,Was very hesitant with my purchase of this. I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t taking to the idea of it but when I got it in my hands I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t put it down. Truly a beautiful piece of tech,5
influenster,iphone,"I have always been a huge fan of Apple products and iPhones, but I had held onto my iPhone 5s for about 5 years and never really felt the desire to upgrade until the iPhone X was released.¬† I ordered it the very first day it came available and I am so glad I did!¬† I absolutely love it!!!¬† The face recognition is so convenient and works perfectly.¬† I love the upgraded camera features it has and the better battery life.¬† The change I like most is how they got rid of the home button on the front of the phone.¬† With my iPhone 4s, I had issues after a while and my home button didn't always work.¬† Since this doesn't have a button, that's one thing I don't have to worry about breaking!¬† Overall this is an amazing phone!¬†¬†I would highly recommend this product!",5
influenster,iphone,"I bought this phone for the camera, and display screen. This phone does not disappoint. I love the new Animoji s that come with this phone. I appreciate that the phone unlocks with my face, but sometimes find frustrating when I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t put my phone in front of my face. Overall this is a great phone with awesome new features to play with. If your a techie then this phone is for you!",5
influenster,iphone,"I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been an Apple user since the original iPhone, and I do seem to enjoy my iPhone X the most. The camera quality is great, the size of the screen is pleasant, and the phone itself is not too big. It is fairly expensive as most apple products are, but in my opinion worth it. It does take some serious getting used to without the center home button, but after a few weeks, you get used to it.",5
influenster,iphone,"this is actually a great product¬† like the facial rec feature but i personally think apple is starting to outdo themselves there is no way i would send more than the 1,000 dollars that was paid for the x alone its literally unrealistic",3
influenster,iphone,"The iPhone X is a great phone, albeit overpriced! The camera is incredible -- such a clear photo with vibrant hues and saturation. What I found amazing was that the front camera also offers high definition photos (which, on my past phone, was not the case in the slightest!) I have found the retina/eye scanner to be incredibly helpful. I never have to type in passwords anymore (such a time saver) because my retina essentially serves as my password. My biggest concern is obviously the price. It is a $1,000 smartphone, which is a tough pill to swallow. Overall it's a great, user friendly phone. The lack of a home button was something I had to get used to, but it became second nature in a matter of a few days.",4
influenster,iphone,"My bf surprised me with an early Christmas present, and let√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just say I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in love. The screen is basically the same size as any of the iPhone pluses so that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a plus hehe. The camera is amazing I love using the portrait mode. The phone is fast and hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t given me any problems. I just miss having a spot for a normal aux cord. It is an expensive phone though.",5
influenster,iphone,"It took me longer to live my IPhone X because it has NO button. I actually disliked it so much in the beginning that I considered returning it. After weeks of learning to work without a button, I actually got used to it and don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how I lived without facial recognition. When unlocking the phone it actually takes longer to hold my phone up and swipe up versus just my fingerprint. There is a huge upside to facial recognition and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s passwords!! I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to type them because my face opens any app or site I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve logged into. I also love the size of the phone for handling and keeping in my pocket. Quality is amazing for taking pictures and viewing/taking videos. Apple iPhone X",4
influenster,iphone,This is my #GiftCrush. As a person who needs to take great photos and be able share it through all social media. I really want this product. I feel like it would bring my music blog and social media pages so much more recognition. Plus if I go to networking events with an iPhone X it would seem like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on top of my game.,5
influenster,iphone,"The iPhone X was my first upgrade in years. I preordered it so it arrived the day they were released, and man, was I happy when it arrived! This phone is unlike any other iPhone. I think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the perfect size, the colors on the screen are beautiful, and the camera is awesome! I know a lot of people complain about the notch but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s honestly never bothered me. I really love this phone and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so glad I got it!",5
influenster,iphone,The new Iphone X is amazing!¬† The screen is bigger since they took the button away.¬† The graphics on the camera are stellar.¬† The emoji app where you can record your voice to match the movements of an emoji is beyond amazing.¬† And last but not least.... the face recognition is unbelievable.,5
influenster,iphone,"Apple is so so much better then Samsung. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had Apple products all my life. I love the IPhone X, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a bit harder to use then the traditional iPhones but you do get use to it afterwards. It is a little bit pricy for a phone but your paying for high quality!",5
influenster,iphone,"Apple iPhone X S MaxI absolutely love this phone, I purchased mine straight from at&t, it has an amazing camera and speaker system on it, it's easy to use,light weight and very entertaining, I can stay on it for hour's, it's also water proof, I can't wait to see what they come up with next, I'm blown away by the performance of this phone alone, although a little expensive it's worth every penny of it.",5
influenster,iphone,I have had a lot of iPhones and most of the time I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll get one and upgrade as soon as a new one is available but with the iPhone X I honestly don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need anything else!! I was worried about not having the home button because I used the Touch ID for a ton of my apps but I figured I would give it a try and I love it!! I also went from an iPhone plus to the smaller x and I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t imagine needing anything else!! It is the perfect size with a large enough screen for watching youtube and the Face ID works amazingly in low light conditions too 10 out of 10 would recommend,5
influenster,iphone,"I hate this phone. I have since the day I got it. Phone will only answer on speaker phone. Will not connect to Bluetooth in my Jeep without doing it manually. Apple has been awful to deal with. When I first started having problems I had it less than 2 months, they wanted me to accept a refurbished phone after paying full price for a new one. Customer service was horrible and hung up on me after telling me that I needed to get an Android. Filed a complaint and still to this day, no return call or resolution. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.",2
influenster,iphone,I love my iPhone X! I was extremely nervous to switch from a home button to having no home button but I got used to it extremely quick. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m excited to upgrade to the iPhone Max for the bigger screen but if you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mind the screen size then I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say no to an iPhone X! #TeamiPhone √∞≈∏‚Äú¬±,5
influenster,iphone,"The first thing is that i was 90% scared that the new phone wasn‚Äôt gonna be what I expected but all my electronic devices are Apple so i decided to take the risk and buy it to my mom and I really love it‚ù§Ô∏è I actually use it more often than her jajaja but I really recommend it üòç if your an apple lover you‚Äôll absolutely love it and if your not trust me, you‚Äôll also love it because of it‚Äôs upgrades and moreüíï Apple iPhone X",5
influenster,iphone,"IPhone or Android? Well having experience with both products, I personally prefer iPhone. I like how easy it is to use and the connectivity between other devices is something I make use of. My MacBook, iMac, and iPhone now all connect together which makes everything more convenient. The iPhone X is very very pricy. I do think that it is more expensive than it is worth. The face recognition can be annoying sometimes but it is much better than I expected. It works in the dark which is nice. The camera quality is very clear.",4
influenster,iphone,i would rate it as a 1000 it is big phone and i like it l like to have it one day and i need a ipone i have nevre had a ipone be for nd i like to have on it has grat ge bits it is the bes i give it a 4000 on all of your stuff and i love the culler i love it sooo muah..,5
influenster,iphone,I phone X is one of the best. I have multiple apps and it all open with Face ID. Super easy to use. Just glare at the apps and open. How awesome it that. I can‚Äôt live without it. I am definitely recommend this to all Influenster who have a lot of apps.,5
influenster,iphone,"I recently switched from the iPhone 6s plus to the iPhone X and I'm in love.Major changes are the camera. 1000 times better and with self portrait mode!Second there is no home screen but it took me a day to get used to.Also the alarm, calculator etc is in the top left and pull down instead of scroll up.Lastly, my thumb print never worked on my previous phones and I never liked using a 100000 passcode to unlock my phone so the face recognition analyzer is the best.",5
influenster,iphone,I love love love my IPhone X! For years I hated anything apple. I wouldn‚Äôt use anything apple especially iPhones. It was too simple and not customizable enough for me. When this phone came out I waited weeks for one to be in stock and I absolutely wouldn‚Äôt trade it for by other phone! It doesn‚Äôt feel like an iPhone with all the apple perks!! One of the best tech purchases I‚Äôve ever made!,5
influenster,iphone,"I would like get this iPhone and test it for my youtube Subcierses and thx for your help ,I was dreading losing the home button and having a smaller phone in my hand but my wife‚Äôs 6s Plus now seems like it was from a different era. The Face ID, 3D Touch, Swipe System and Touch to Open all work like a dream, meaning I can whizz around the phone with minimal thought and effort. The size is perfect, after loving the larger Plus series I now realise the X is better balanced for me without reverting to a smaller screen. I love being able to swipe between open apps without having to manoeuvre my thumb up and down the screen, meaning, with my poor memory, if I wanted to write down something from, say, the calculator into notes I can do so easily with a flick of my thumb. The wireless charging is outstanding, so much so, I‚Äôve bought chargers for my bedroom and my lounge and hope I never have to go back to plugging the cable in again. The screen is absolutely stunning. Watching videos and looking at photographs is a pleasure and, in all honesty, makes me want to watch more which I‚Äôve never bothered with before on a phone. The camera also seems much better but I‚Äôve not had chance to experiment yet as it‚Äôs something I need to learn more about. Overall, I was worried about taking a punt on the X but I know now that if I‚Äôd not upgraded (as was my plan) or gone with the 8 Plus, I‚Äôd be pretty gutted right now. Apple has managed to reignite my love of the smart phone again with the most perfect bit of kit I could have imagined. Thank you!Cons: The cost is absolutely crippling for people like me. Luckily I got a fair forces discount (20%) on the contract price which brought it into my range, though still massively top end. The only other problem I have is the reachability function. It‚Äôs something I use often but struggle to get right on the X, especially when there‚Äôs something to activate right where my thumb will be when I attempt to swipe down. I dare say, without my wireless charger next to my chair, the battery could be an issue as I‚Äôm a heavy user of the phone, so I can‚Äôt say either way with certainty at the moment.

influenster,iphone,Received this for my birthday! My birthday is Christmas Eve. This was on my wish list this year and I needed to upgrade my phone. I love being able to send the Animoji! It‚Äôs extremely simple and easy to use. I like the changes they made to adapt for a bigger screen.,5
influenster,iphone,"My first every preference in mobile phone! ‚ù§Ô∏èü§©ü•≥I used all the versions of Apple mobiles and loved every series! Iphone X was the best release in apple products last year. Display, it‚Äôs features, every single feature was new. Camera is the greatest advantage and it alao has portrait mode in it. Price is little bit costly but worth buying! I definitely recommend buying Iphone X who are interested!",5
influenster,iphone,"Great phone! The camera is just something else. Had the Samsung 9 before and although they have similar screen and resolution the camera is better. At least for me. I always recommend it to others, including my husband. Lol",5
influenster,iphone,I have the iPhone XR and I love it. Wasn‚Äôt sure about not having a button at first but the Face ID is so fast and convenient! The picture quality on the front cam and back cam is amazing! Portrait mode on the front cam is my new favorite addition! Also for the XR you get to order it in colors which is really nice! The phone is so fast compared to their other phones. I like swiftness of swiping to control everything. Love it!,5
influenster,iphone,I currently made the switch from a Samsung Galaxy S5 to an iPhone X and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. I know it is a drastic change but this phone is like a smart computer in your hand. Amazing picture and video quality. Fast processing and I love that it will only unlock with my face. Very easy to get use to not having a home button and maneuvering the different functions. Very user friendly and I highly recommend it!,5
influenster,iphone,"Hands down the best iPhone yet! Great phone, great operating system, great camera, and great overall look. Absolutely love this phone and it‚Äôs definitely worth the high price, Apple continues to knock any competitors out.",5
influenster,iphone,Somebody please tell me this is real because do this causes like so much money into stores but I really think the iPhone x has a good technique and like everything is so good about it the camera oh I phones are good but I think the iPhone x is the best I never had an iPhone x so i know it is real,5
influenster,iphone,"I love my iPhone X! The cameras are amazing and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. I also do not miss the home button at all, I actually feel like the gestures are a lot more natural now. I really like the size and love the full face screen. I was hesitant in purchasing because of how expensive it is, but I‚Äôm so glad that I bought it because I am loving it and haven‚Äôt found one thing about it that I don‚Äôt like.",5
influenster,iphone,"I have this phone. It was an upgrade from my iPhone 7plus.  I like the feature of Face ID recognition when I unlock my phone.  As this is only able to be done by me.  However, if face not recognized then you can enter password.  The photos are nice and crisp.  The only problem is sometimes my callers can‚Äôt hear me and service is bad.  May not be the phone and maybe it is my sprint service that is bad.",5
influenster,iphone,I got my iPhone X in November I upgraded from iPhone 7plus and I hate it! It wa a big mistake literally the only thing I like about it is the front portrait mode and it is so expensive its ridiculous! I would recommend getting ting this phone wait for something new or get the 8n,2
influenster,iphone,"Verizon for Christmas, #paymentplan, merry Christmas to me üòÅüòÅ love the new phone the facial recognition is amazing. Used to be a Droid fan, my teenager swapped me over to iPhones. I‚Äôm glad I switched. üëçüèªüëçüèªüòú",5
influenster,iphone,I bought this to take better photos but I do not see any improvement in my photos. It sometimes freezes up and won‚Äôt let me press any buttons (not locked just frozen) I honestly think iPhone just robs us all constantly making us buy new phones and cords to their accord. I appreciate that this one did not crack in the first week so I will say this is more durable than the previous models.,4
influenster,iphone,I love love love my iPhone! I‚Äôve had one since the iPhone 4 and I will never go back to an android device. The iPhone is so easy to use. And with the X you don‚Äôt miss the home button after you get used to the gestures.,5
influenster,iphone,"I think this phone is a little overpriced, we bought this for my husband and i really tho there would be a huge difference between my iphone 7 and the X but not, the camera is slightly better and i find most of the new mechanism annoying, i know it just seems to make things easier but im not sure it does.",4
influenster,iphone,"I love the iPhone X. What can I say I have had every iPhone since they came out. I love that there is no home button and that the size of the X is more like the original iPhone. I highly recommend the iphoneX, it is much more expensive then every phone on the market. But in my opinion it is worth it.",5
influenster,iphone,I‚Äôm only giving it four stars because I miss the finger scannerThe finger scanner is a lot faster than the phone not recognizing my face at night and having to enter in a six digit code :/Besides that the phone is amazing and has the best camera everEveryone thinks I use a professional camera!,4
influenster,iphone,"I love having a big screen and all of the face recognition features are really nice, but I‚Äôm still not over only having the lighting port and not having my headphone jack. It makes it so difficult to charge with headphones because then you either need a dongle or Bluetooth, but overall it‚Äôs a nice phone. Although, I do also think that it cracks easier than my iphone6s did.",4
influenster,iphone,"It is a spectacular phone. I am obsesses with the facial recognition opposed to using your thumb. Also, the camera quality is superb. You notice everything and it is very clear. I also like the fact that the screen is bigger too.",5
influenster,iphone,"Besides the different camerra and portrait feature in photo, this new iphone is basically the same the the 8th. But it‚Äôs durable and water resistant. I‚Äôve been using it in sauna and steam room but it‚Äôs still working fine for over a year.",5
influenster,iphone,I love my iPhone X. The notch doesn‚Äôt bother me at all and no... no one mistakes it for a Samsung. The quality of the photos are great and the pixels that are used in the screen make it look great. It‚Äôs very pricey but if you can afford it then why not?,5
influenster,iphone,"There are probably a ton of specs on this phone that I haven‚Äôt even found but still I enjoy having it. I‚Äôd say the price is high for sure, but, I feel all phones are pricey these days. Simple to use and fun to have. I would improve on the face/finger print recognition as I have issues with mine a lot. Overall I do recommend it!¬† Apple iPhone X",5
influenster,iphone,"I got this at a discounted price so maybe that's why I believe it was worth every penny. Seriously a huge update from what I was using before. The face recognition feature is amazing and at first I thought I wouldn't be used to not having a home button but after a few uses, I honestly prefer the new swiping to home method. I'm so impressed with this!",5
influenster,iphone,"For the most part, I love my phone. It was a bit of an adjustment from the 6S but it was mainly just little things like layout and such. I love how seamlessly things work. For instance my Bluetooth items connect much easier, however things like turning off connection to WiFi is a pain because it‚Äôs automatic. But definitely, overall, it‚Äôs a reliable phone!",4
influenster,iphone,"Loveee my new iPhone! I like that it‚Äôs normal size, the picture features are amazing!! Who needs a photographer when you have a phone like this! It‚Äôs easy to adjust to the new features, only took about a hour to get them all down! The sound is spectacular! However I will say if you‚Äôre not interested in the new features it‚Äôs pretty similar to the iPhone 6/7",5
influenster,iphone,"This phone is good I‚Äôll give Apple that, but I just really don‚Äôt think that it is worth spending $1000 on. I mean yeah it has facial recognition but it also doesn‚Äôt have a place to plug in headphones other than where you put the charger, which to me is just a huge pet peeve.",4
influenster,iphone,"Loving my new iPhone! I‚Äôve had it for about 4 months so I waited a while before reviewing. It is comfortable to use, easy to transition from an older iPhone to this one. Being without a home button takes some getting used to, but not too difficult. I really like the facial recognition for when you‚Äôre in a hurry and don‚Äôt want to remember passcodes.",5
influenster,iphone,"#GiftCrush #contest @InfluensterI am soooo hoping that Santa plans on leaving me the iPhone X phone under the tree for Christmas this year! ü§ûüèªüôèüèªSeveral of my friends have it already, so I have seen it in person and it is amazing!  The picture quality is so crystal and clean, I had no idea how much better it would be then my 6 plus - but wow!! ‚ú®",5
influenster,iphone,"I have he just about every type of phone there is and my iPhone X definitely tops the list for best phone I‚Äôve ever had. Not having a home button takes some getting used to, but once you get it down it‚Äôs so efficient. I absolutely love the portrait mode camera setting feature as well. I no longer need to carry my DSLR around with me everywhere.",5
influenster,iphone,"Im currently using IPhone XR. Im loving it so far. Its comparatively cheaper in price thn IPhone X XS and Xmax. It has few different colors, i have the white. It has so many cool features. The camera quality is really awesome. I would definitely recommend",5
influenster,iphone,"Definitely an amazing phone. Camera and picture quality is absolutely stunning‚Äîportrait mode is amazing. However, considering it is Apple‚Äôs first phone like this, there‚Äôs some room for improvement. Definitely need to make Face ID faster and more reliable. If you don‚Äôt want to see fingerprints, I highly suggest getting the Silver version.",4
influenster,iphone,"This is a great product overall! The camera, the quality of the display and the smoothness of the software. Video editing and mobile gaming is very very crisp in this device. The camera is my favorite and would completely recommend this Apple smartphone to anyone!",5
influenster,iphone,"I love this phone! The camera quality is great and the new screen quality really takes the graphics on this phone to another level! Well done Apple- it‚Äôs still super reliable a year later (even though I wish the battery life were a tad better, but it‚Äôs not bad)",5
influenster,iphone,I just recently got this phone as a gift from my boyfriend. I have had a iPhone before but this one is a little bit different then the one I had previously I like the phone for the most part but some of the features are hard to maneuver but it might just take time to get the hang of the changes. But overall I really like the phone.,5

But overall I really like the phone.,5
influenster,iphone,"It's a great phone it's definitely an upgrade from my android but it does have some things I don't like. Like how it's literally made only from glass and how one drop and it's no good. I also don't like the facial recognition because someone can just point my phone to my face and they can get into it, but besides that it's alright.",5
influenster,iphone,i‚Äôve been an apple and  i recently upgraded to x .. at first i wasn‚Äôt sureBec i like the big phone and this is smaller than the plus but full screen. I gave it a try and i loved it..,5
influenster,iphone,"I simply cannot live without my IPhone X! One of my favorite apps that is exclusive to IPhone is Hipstamatic, a photo app. Lots of photo storage with the option to expand storage if you pay a lil extra a month... totally worth it for someone like me who takes a lot of photos. Runs smooth, love the constant app updates.",5
influenster,iphone,They don‚Äôt have the review for the xr so this is mine for it. I like the screen but I don‚Äôt like how it cuts into the camera at the top and looks like ears. Pretty much my only complain other than the fact there‚Äôs no headphone jack. The camera quality is good.,4
influenster,iphone,great product because i very like it . i see many people use iphone x they said iphone x is very good you can many things on iphone x. so i¬† very¬† want a iphone x .,5
influenster,iphone,"Love love love this phone! The face identity is amazing as well as the camera! I use the camera feature almost daily with 4 kids!!! Easy to use and worth the price point! Highly recommend! Also, recommend getting a case!!!",5
influenster,iphone,love this phone that every time Apple comes out with a new version I always end up getting it.¬† I had family members¬†always telling me Android phones were better but I always disagree.¬† Always tell em to buy apple products because I never have virus issues neither do they every slow down on me.,5
influenster,iphone,Omggg I got this birthday and omg it was the best decision I ever made at first I thought I wouldn‚Äôt like it because of the glass back but now that I have I love how the phone is so smooth and has no glitches the battery also last me all day long without haveing to charge till I‚Äôm ready for bed MUST BUY!!!,5
influenster,iphone,"#giftcrush I would love to have an iPhone. I need a new phone and have only ever had Androids with the exception of my iPods in the past. I would love to get an iPhone this Christmas (doesn't have to be a x, just picked one for the picture).",5
influenster,iphone,"A lot of my friends were hesitant to make the switch to iPhone X when it came out due to the absence of a home button. However, after using it for five months, I have absolutely no problem with having no home button. I like the big screen and I actually prefer the swiping to having a home button.",5
influenster,iphone,"I love the iPhone X. Albeit was expensive, I hadn‚Äôt upgraded my phone in 4 years so it was needed. It was a great change from the iPhone 6s Plus. Easy to use with lots of extras. I do wish iPhones were more customizable.",5
influenster,iphone,"I‚Äôve had my iPhone X for a few weeks now and I have to say I love the upgrades, but miss my Apple iPhone 7 Plus . I think the best feature of the phone is the camera! It‚Äôs amazing and the parts I ‚Äòm still getting used to would be the loss of the home button and the size.",4
influenster,iphone,it is great i love the color beacuse it is bright so i will like to promotr your goods wow wow wow¬† wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow¬† wow wo wo wow wow wowowo wow wow wow wo thanks,5
influenster,iphone,"Man this phone is awesome. The apps alone are great. The limitations are unimaginable! The IPhone X has met my expectations and has gone beyond what I‚Äôve wanted it to do. It has withstood my 5 yr old, as well as getting wet and being dropped repeatedly! This was a great investment so far!",5
influenster,iphone,Do I have to say this is the best phone ever? I think some people are Apple fans and some people aren‚Äôt but I love how easy this phone is to use and how the images come out. The screen is beautiful and is pretty hard to crack. I drop mine a lot and it‚Äôs never gotten a scratch.,5
influenster,iphone,I love this new iPhone! I had the plus so going down in size took some getting used to. The camera is so good on this phone and gives professional quality photos.,5
influenster,iphone,"This is the best phone they have released yet! It is very user friendly but also customizable so it doesn‚Äôt get as boring as some of the older models were. The screen resolution is amazing. The speakers are very loud, and the picture quality is a force to be reckoned with!",5
influenster,iphone,"I love this phone. I‚Äôve had it since it came out as a gift from my hubby and it hasn‚Äôt messed up on me once. The camera quality is amazing, and I‚Äôm able to take some really beautiful pics with it.",5
influenster,iphone,"The iPhone X delivers a great blend of handheld comfort and a big, gorgeous 5.8-inch OLED screen. The rear-facing telephoto camera outshoots the iPhone 8 Plus in low light, and the front-facing camera snaps impressive portrait mode selfies. Face ID generally works fine.",4
influenster,iphone,"OW.. this iOS the best phone I ever had. In my opinion this phone worth the high price. its a compact phone, and don't think about no home button was something bad..you just need to get used to. ¬†the pictures in this phone are amazing, with many filters to choose",5
influenster,iphone,"A amazing phone! I love it. The picture quality is amazing and the phone is just so easy to use. No home button is great, and you get more screen size. The only thing is the price but then again its apple. All their phones are pricey but this one was totally worth it.",5
influenster,iphone,"I got the iPhone X when it first came out in the silver option. From the very beginning, the screen went beyond my expectations. The design was sleek and nice, but it felt like an expensive device - and for the price that I paid for it, it definitely lived up to it.",5
influenster,iphone,"I'm loving my iPhone X so far. I just got it in yesterday and so far it's amazing. Great screen, colors look so vibrant. The speed is great, camera takes great pictures and video and the feel of the phone is really nice. It feels very fancy and sleek, which I love.",5
influenster,iphone,"My iPhone makes it easy to create, apply and share my favourite Caribbean secrets!  I have been playing with this model just over a year.  And I was stoked with the new application upgrade.  I have always admire the ease of use and flexibility of what Apple bringsü§≥üèΩ",5
influenster,iphone,I recently go this in black and It‚Äôs great! It‚Äôs different from the other iPhones so it takes some getting used to. I love how it‚Äôs all screen on the front so you‚Äôre not wasting space on border. It is a little bit heavier than the other iPhones but it‚Äôs not bad.,4
influenster,iphone,"This is a definitely a great gift that id love to have, very easy to use almost the same like the old iPhone models but better, meet everyone technology lover expectations, everybody should buy it. #appleX",5
influenster,iphone,"Well, I‚Äôve always been a huge iPhone/Apple user and always had pride being a supporter of Apple products. Both me and my husband preordered these phones, stayed up until 5AM that night on the phone with T-Mobile. When receiving this phone I fell in love with the look of it (Got Silver White version). It took me 2 months to realize that I hate it, I use my phone a lot, and the actual user experience for me was disappointing. Because of the new Screenshot method, I now have 500 random screenshots of my lockscreen simply because of the way I pick my phone up off the table. I CAN TELL YOU AS A MAJOR APPLE USER, I have never had an iPhone to freeze like a windows 98 computer, but this phone does and I have to reset it every time. It‚Äôs sad to see this company change its products, Steve Jobbs would be disappointed.  iPhone had a trade mark of being behind in how advanced the specs were but what made this company wasn‚Äôt about advanced the products were, but simply how they perfected and simplified something so wonderful. Not anymore I guess.",3
influenster,iphone,"Looooooovvveeee my phone! The screen swiping quality is smooth and effortless. I love that Apple Pay is a thing in most places I shop. It‚Äôs a bit too expensive, but I got mine for $160 because of a phone update contract I had with Sprint. The camera quality is immaculate.",5
influenster,iphone,"This is a very incredible phone. The camera quality is unreal , it takes such a clear and crisps photo. The storage is very large capacity. The features are like every other iphone just bigger and better. Very pricey but it's worth it. Great phone!",4
influenster,iphone,"I absolutely love my iPhone X!! It is by far the best phone I have had. I love the camera and portrait mode. I can take beautiful, flawless pictures of my children. The screen is big and nice. Price is a bit high but worth it. Apps run smoothly.",5
influenster,iphone,"I love my iPhone X and am very happy with the purchase. While it was quite expensive, it was a much needed upgrade from my iPhone 6s. So much faster and better capable. The full screen image with no buttons is definitely my favorite feature.",5
influenster,iphone,I love this phone! I wanna get the max for a bigger size but this phone is great! Besides the price it is pretty good. One down side is the back can crack easily if you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a proper case. But it has a great screen and battery time !,5
influenster,iphone,"This phone is not worth the hype or the money. I upgrade from an my iphone to the 10 because i was egilable for an upgrade and i wanted the newst iphone. I hate that it doesnt have a headphone jack. I also get made when i want to charge my phone while listening to music. Face ID, HATE IT. They give you the opinion not to use it but touch ID isnt available because the phone doesnt have a home button. Its just like every other iphone expect they added stupid and useless features. Who cares about talking emojis, face id is stupid. The battery life is good. For not charging my phone for 9hrs ill be at 65 or 50%. The camrea it great also. It has the 4k live effect going on. Other then thats, thats the only two things i could say its good about this phone, and for it to cost 1000 plus tax that isnt saying much. I also heard apple might discontinue this phone due to low sells. So....",3
influenster,iphone,I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have this phone but my brother dose it has the best Quality to take pictures it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a perfect size it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not to big or either small I recommend this what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s is so cool is you can open the phone just pulling you face in front of it,5
influenster,iphone,Honestly it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s an okay phone but I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s as much money as it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s selling for. It is pretty much the same as all other iPhones just looks a little cooler than the generations before. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s way to easy to crack in my opinion.,3
influenster,iphone,Omg I love this phone the camera is absolutely amazing. It is kind of on the expensive side but trust me it is totally worth buying. To me the camera and speaker are super important and this phone totally fulfilled my expectations.,5
influenster,iphone,I would love this new iPhone it looks and is awesome this would be a dream come true I have never won anything in my life and maybe this can be my chance that I have never had hopefully I get picked but if I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get to get this iPhone X I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m happy with whatever else gets thrown my way!,5
influenster,iphone,"Got this as a Christmas present from my boyfriend. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a really nice phone, but not many apps are adjusted to it. I have dropped it about 2 times so far, and there is not even a scratch. One thing I noticed with my phone is that it lags during multitasking when on a phone call.",4
influenster,iphone,"Love love love this phone! Let me just say I was nervous to have a phone without a home button, but this phone has not let me down! I love the screen and just honestly everything about this phone! Works great and looks great too",5
influenster,iphone,Great phone but the OS can be buggy since the notch messes up the screen dimensions. I also wish it was a bit smaller so you can use one hand at all times. I cannot press all 4 corners with my thumb without adjusting my hand.,4
influenster,iphone,I love my phone! I use it for everything! I film my YouTube videos with it as well! Best iPhone yet! Plus I love not having a home button! Once you get used to not having it you won‚Äôt miss it at all ! Apple iPhone X,5
influenster,iphone,"I love this photo. The photo quality is amazing which I need with all the photos i take in a day. The extra capabilities I have is even better, i love being able to not use my fingers to open my phone when i have dirty hands.",5
influenster,iphone,I just recently upgraded to the iPhone X it‚Äôs way to use it just takes some time getting used to. I don‚Äôt like that it only comes on one size I would of loved to have gotten a bigger version. Other than that love the phone.,4
influenster,iphone,"I love my phone, it‚Äôs much better than the previous iPhone 7 I had, even though I enjoyed that as well while waiting for the upgraded stuff. So many new things, your personal emoji to use and all. Highly recommend!!",5
influenster,iphone,I would love to be gifted an Apple iPhone X. You can buy them at any phone retailer or even Walmart. They are very expensive but they are super easy to use and super light. They could be improved with better glass.,5
influenster,iphone,"This phone is outstanding compared to apples past products! While the price may seem high, the overall quality of the phone and it‚Äôs included features are definitely worth it. It‚Äôs sleek design and oled screen are outstanding!",5
influenster,iphone,"I‚Äôve heard so many positive things about this phone! I‚Äôve thought about getting it, unfortunately it‚Äôs just too expensive! The camera on it is remarkable! It looks like you‚Äôre taking photos with a professional camera.",5
influenster,iphone,"Very high price for a very good phone! And its worth every penny! I love my iphone X! Everyone looks to you like oh you have the iphone x! Its almost incredible the camera, the fastest it is! Everything!!",5
influenster,iphone,I‚Äôm a newbie for iPhones came from android. I was sceptic at first but once I dove in was easy and amazing . Not a total transformation from android once u figure out the phone but better experience.,5
influenster,iphone,"This is my ultimate #giftcrush !!! I would love to get this for Christmas!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è Maybe Santa will be extra good to me this year! I love watching the online reviews about it, makes me excited to upgrade!",5
influenster,iphone,"I am so excited for a new I phone and I love screen, the size and all the features except the face recognition.  I am hoping for this for Christmas.  It's a little pricey but so worth it!!! Reccomend!",5
influenster,iphone,"My friend owns the iPhone X and it‚Äôs the best. I own a iPhone 8 that I love, but so wish I had the X. There‚Äôs a lot of new features that I love. I also like thats it‚Äôs the size of regular iPhones.",5
influenster,iphone,"I love my iPhone X. I don‚Äôt like the price we are paying for it on ur plan. But i never have any issues. I love all the apps i can download, it allows me to message, and call whoever i need to.",5
influenster,iphone,Love my iPhone X. It took a little time to get used to some of the new gestures but it‚Äôs really a cool phone. Wished the launches a Plus size already but this is already a step in the right direction!,5
influenster,iphone,I recently switched from the galaxy S6 edge and it was a big difference coming over to apple. There‚Äôs something‚Äôs I can‚Äôt do with apple that I could with android but over all I‚Äôm satisfied!,4
influenster,iphone,"I love this cell phone! The missing home button has already been disabled after a while. Wonderful technology, which makes me always keep myself as a loyal customer of apple.",5
influenster,iphone,Love love love this phone! As a mom I mainly use my phone for taking pictures of my kids and the photos this phone takes look like they could be professional! I love everything about this phone.,5
influenster,iphone,Loved the iPhone X and the face-id works 10 times faster than touch -Id. The picture are beautiful and the portrait mode in incredible. It‚Äôs an amazing device. Apple iPhone X,5
influenster,iphone,"Before my most recent iPhone (the X), I had the Apple iPhone 8 Plus - 64GB - Gold. The X overall is a great phone, but for me, I‚Äôd rather have the 8 Plus back, which is why 4 stars. I like the Face ID, but I wish fingerprint was also offered because you actually have to stare at your phone for the face to work (obviously), but sometimes I just want to pick it up and open quick with my thumb. Also, when double clicking the side button for Apple Store purchases, I always end up taking a screenshot because the volume buttons are directly on the other side, so while clicking with my thumb, my pointer hits the volume down. I also like the round bottom button better than the ‚Äúswipe up.‚Äù I also wish all iPhones had a clipboard like Samsung - Galaxy S6 With 32GB Memory Cell Phone - Black (sprint) (pretty much all Samsung‚Äôs to my knowledge), to hold more than one copied item at a time.",4

influenster,iphone,This phone is very great it don‚Äôt freeze the colors are great the emoji‚Äòs are amazing and one thing I didn‚Äôt like about it is I dropped it one time and it broke The backside broke üòï,5
influenster,iphone,"I loved this phone. I recently upgraded to the Xs, and see no difference. The portrait mode is awesome, it has a sleek and slim design, and best of all comes with so much storage!",5
influenster,iphone,"A perfect phone for this updated life. A very sophisticated device from apple that is totally a screen. That can respond to touch, voice and even a glance. Very nice  Apple",5
influenster,iphone,"I got this phone for Christmas as a gift. Honestly, I wasn‚Äôt really excited because I had a working phone and felt that getting a new one,especially an expensive ome like this, is a wate of money. I still feel that way - I would never buy it for myself- it‚Äôs super expensive for a phone.However, I love usinh it. The biggest pro is the camera! Ughh... my photos look amazing and people always ask me whether I use a professional camera. There‚Äôs a ‚Äúportrait‚Äù option on the camera that blurs the background and focuses on the objects so it makes it look like you used professional lighting. The face recognition is also useful - I don‚Äôt have to type my passwords anymore - it saves time. A con, however, is that the phone is pretty new and there‚Äôs little bugs that I‚Äôm guessing will be soft with the new iOs updates. Overall, amazing product if you can afford it but not a must have.",5
influenster,iphone,"I don‚Äôt like apple as a company. I think they definitely take advantage of their customers and coming out with a yearly iphone takes away the fun out of having a new phone because i simply does not last. However after 3 years of having my iphone 6s and really struggling because software/ tech loft in general updates so fast, I needed to keep up. I thought of getting the samsung or google phones but I ended up coming to apple as ultimately they have what the people need and that‚Äôs the ultimate technology. So far the main improvements of owing an iphone X was the better camera resolution, the bigger screen, the battery lasting longer. So nothing cray, just updated necessary to keep up with society really",4
influenster,iphone,The hype was real for this when it first came out and tbh it‚Äôs nothing different just the fact that it has Face ID and such but I mean it‚Äôs a really nice phone tho,4
influenster,iphone,"I‚Äôve had my phone for about two weeks now. I switched over from the iPhone 7plus which in size was a bit of getting used to because my hands were so used to a bigger phone. My home button on my iPhone 7 however didn‚Äôt work for almost a year so I was already used to not having a home button when switching over. I love love LOVE how this color looks especially with the metallic look on the sides of the phone. I love the facial recognition especially how I can use it for Apple Pay. A lot of people say my mother and I look alike so I even tried to see if the camera would pick up that she was me and it didn‚Äôt!! LOVE IT lol. At first it was a little frustrating having to get used to the smaller keyboard and the swiping up for the multitasking option, having to learn how to use this phone was definitely a mission but I love my phone overall. I‚Äôm going to have to start wearing makeup though because, this camera? INSANE!",5
influenster,iphone,"I‚Äôm not very happy with this phone, especially with the incredibly steep price. When I first got the phone, I had an otter box case and glass screen protector put in the phone in store the moment I bought it. I‚Äôm one of those people who is super careful with their phones. I‚Äôve had significant problems, I got a brand new phone $1000+ and off the batt I had issues. There were blackouts, freezes, random power off, etc. I went to Apple and they tried to give me a REFURBISHED phone. I paid for a BRAND NEW phone, it‚Äôs not working, and they try to give me a REFURBISHED phone, after they couldn‚Äôt seem to figure out what‚Äôs wrong with mine. It‚Äôs ridiculous. Apple is definitely no longer king in the tech community. You‚Äôre no longer paying for innovation and quality. You‚Äôre now just paying for the name. It‚Äôs ridiculous.",3
influenster,iphone,"I got my iPhone X about two weeks ago and am in love. ¬†It's great to have the Face ID and the full screen phone. ¬†The resolution is beautiful, and the camera is great. ¬†I thought it would take forever to get used to without the home button, but I've already adapted. ¬†I was messing around on my mom's phone, which is the 7, and I kept wanting to swipe up instead of using the home button. ¬†it's crazy how you quickly you adapt. ¬†I did have some issues with my Face ID not working. ¬†Apple support was great, and I ended up having to go to the Apple store to get it fixed. ¬†I was in and out in 20 minutes with a new phone. ¬†Love Apple!",5
influenster,iphone,Alright so there are a lot of things that I LOVE about this phone. Let's start with the cons. Whenever I talk to someone on the phone it sounds like they're far away or their voice is being muffled so I have to have it on speaker anytime I talk to someone. Since that's not too often I'm able to look past it.¬†Pros: Face recognition. Animojis. 4K camera. The camera is the best part. It's worth it for that alone. The video it shoots is incredible. The portrait mode is better than the iPhone 7 Plus too. I definitely recommend getting this phone if you're tossed up between an older version and this one.,4
influenster,iphone,"I purchased the Apple iPhone X a month or two after it came out and I absolutely love it! It is easily one of the best smartphones out there in my opinion. I can also say it is most definitely worth the hefty price tag. The OLED screen is absolutely stunning and very clear. The color pigment of the screen is stunning and very bright. The edge to edge glass is also a nice feature to have, it gives the screen a minimalistic and modern design.  The size is also excellent, small but the perfect size and the screen clarity is also excellent. The camera quality is close to that of a professional camera. I was blown away by the quality of a few photos I had taken when I first purchased this iPhone. It looked as if I had taken them on a Nikon or Canon. Overall, this was a purchase that was worth every penny. Apple made yet another excellent quality phone!",5
influenster,iphone,"Amazing!!! Just got my new iPhone and I‚Äôm totally in love with it! The display is so crystal clear and nice, the volume is definitely louder than the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, which I had previously. It does take some getting use to having to swipe up from the bottom since no home button and the same with multitask, but I‚Äôm already use to it. Also new spot for control center, but overall very pleased. Also super fast.",5
influenster,iphone,"I love my iPhone X. In many ways, it's so similar to the iPhones preceding this one. The noticeable changes are obviously the lack of a home key. I find the gestures to be intuitive and I got used to them within an hour of using the phone. Obviously, Face ID is a big change. I would say the failure rate is similar to touch ID with the benefit of it learning as you type in your passcode with failed attempts to recognize you, so it's always learning. The camera is great, which is the primary reason I got this phone. That and I didn't want the huge 8+. This is still comfortable enough to fit in my pocket. The screen size does make it hard to reach the corners one handed though. Still, I'm very happy with my phone.",4
influenster,iphone,"I love my new phone. I love the larger screen without having to get a plus that feels too large for me. Love the camera quality and love portrait mode on the camera for the selfie, allows to take better close up photos also. The animoji is also awesome and fun to send to people. Having my messages locked until it has my face recognized and shows me the messages is also great. I can see what I have without having to go in to each app and see the notifications but it also allows from others not seeing them.",5
influenster,iphone,"I honestly love my iPhone X and I‚Äôve always been an Apple fan girl. However, I had a Samsung Note 8 for a while and I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt miss it sometimes! I came back to iPhone after a year and it‚Äôs feels like I never left it. It‚Äôs all pretty much the same. I do love the new iOS 12 update and my battery life is amazing in comparison to my Samsung. The camera is wonderful. My only qualm is I wish we had an app drawer! after being able to organize all of my apps, it‚Äôs hard to look at all those folders/icons again! Otherwise, the phone is fast, camera is clear, and battery is wonderful! I‚Äôd recommend to anyone. :)",4
influenster,iphone,"Okay the price is ridiculous. Also, it really bothers me that Apple completely skipped over an iPhone 9 just because they wanted to an iPhone X to celebrate a decade - could've planned for that a whole lot better. But, I really do love the camera. It makes the most basic thing look so gorgeous on screen. That being said, not much else is impressive so if you don't want a super powerful camera, this phone doesn't have much else to offer.",4
influenster,iphone,"Honestly, this phone has been okay. Not my favorite and I really miss my 7. I do love the size of the screen, but the screen is made of a softer glass and more prone to scratches. With my previous iPhones I never had a screen protector and had them for over a year each. There were no scratches when I got my new phone. With this one I had the phone for 2 weeks and it was already scratched. I also do not care for the face recognition. It‚Äôs a neat function, but at the end of the day the fingerprint scanner was much more snappy and convenient. And I very much miss it!! Wouldn‚Äôt recommend this phone.",3
influenster,iphone,"i stood on line for this phone when it first came out. it was very expensive but i was able to use a payment plan with my carrier. it can be very difficult to learn how to use at first because you have to learn how to do simple functions that in the past required the home button. i do not think the face id is all the its cracked up to be, as i have many issues with it working everyday. i would not recommend this phone to others.",3
influenster,iphone,"Apple has REALLY went the extra mile. I absolutely love my iphone X. The facial recognition is pretty cool. Sometimes it lags and that can be a bit annoying but I still would't opt out of using it. I like the extra security that comes with it. The other big feature is no home button. It takes some getting used to but once you do, it's super natural. I don't know about anyone else, but anytime I get a new phone, tablet, or any new electronic device for that matter, I watch videos to figure out how they work. Saves me a lot of trail and error. I recommend doing it.",5
influenster,iphone,"The iPhone X is absolutely amazing. My favorite features are the Face ID and portrait mode on camera and that there‚Äôs no home button. These three features make the IPhone X an absolute necessity! Although, not being able to listen to music and charge you phone at the same time is a bummer. PS. I recommend getting a protective case and a screen protector due to its cost!   Apple iPhone X",5
influenster,iphone,"I recently upgraded from a 6 Plus and was unsure whether I would like this version better than the 8 Plus.  I‚Äôm really glad I decided to go with the X.  I LOVE the facial recognition feature, although it‚Äôs not 100% accurate.  It took awhile to get used to not having the home button, but I don‚Äôt miss it at all now.  The camera and photo settings are amazing.  As an amateur photographer, I sometimes use my phone instead.  The screen on the X is just as big as the screen on the 8+ so you don‚Äôt give up any space.  I highly recommend this phone!",5
influenster,iphone,"I know the iPhone X is all the hype and unfortunately I fell into it. I wish I would have kept my iPhone 6 Plus. I liked it just as well maybe more. I don‚Äôt like that they took the headphone port away just to sell back the wire to convert headphones to plug into the charging port. You can‚Äôt charge the phone and use headphones at the same time, lame! The only real difference is the Face ID which isn‚Äôt even that cool honestly. I am not happy with this phone, I shouldn‚Äôt have wasted so much money on it",2
influenster,iphone,"WOW, do I love this phone or what! At first I thought with the home button missing it would be impossible to get past and enjoy it, but after getting to use it for a few days it was no issue at all. THE BEST! THING ABOUT THIS PHONE IS THE CAMERA! Portrait mode will be your best friend! I took some photos at a wedding and most people thought it looked like a professional camera. In addition, the size is just right, it holds up great, and holds a charge fairly well. You have to get the iphone X!",5
influenster,iphone,"I absolutely love my iPhone X! I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would like it before I got it but the whole no home button thing took me like 20 min to get use to. It exceeded my expectations and it‚Äôs absolutely worth buying! The best iPhone I‚Äôve had so far! But a lot of apps need to update to the new screen size, other than that love it so much!!! Apple iPhone X",5
influenster,iphone,"I had been wanting the X for awhile and when I broke my 7 plus on a water tubing trip on the 4th of July I legit went home and ordered online for in store pick up and made it to the mall with 20 mins to spare before closing for the holiday. I‚Äôve had the X for a few months now and after a week or two of adjusting to no home button and no Touch ID, I really have come to love it. I do think I will always miss the Touch ID though. I can do without a headphone jack and use bluetooth.",5
influenster,iphone,"Apple continues to out-perform the competition. First of all, iOS is leaps and bounds ahead of the other operations systems, like android‚Äôs. The processing power is more than adequate for a smart phone and feels like it will have good longevity. Battery life is outstanding!! Lastly, the screen is crisp, clear and looks awesome.",5
influenster,iphone,This is an amazing iPhone I really love it it has many new stuff you can try many new things I think it's the best iPhone yet that they had made .Right now this is my favorite iPhone I'm really in love ¬†with it I have learned new stuff and it's so entertaining. I can't explain the love I have for this phone it's amazing!!!,5
influenster,iphone,I just got my new iPhone X in the mail this morning and I love it! I got it through my xfinity service and I‚Äôm paying close to $90 a month for the phone and my service. After 22 months my phone will be payed off and I‚Äôll only pay about $45 a month for my phone plan and that‚Äôs it! My favorite feature so far is the Animoji! It is just the cutest thing ever!,5
influenster,iphone,"Just got mine in the mail and so far it‚Äôs great. I had the 7plus before this one so in getting use to the smaller size, however the screen is much longer so it doesn‚Äôt feel like such a big difference to me. Facial recognition works! It works with my glasses and without. I even used it with a sheet mask on and it worked also.",5
influenster,iphone,"It's ten years since the iPhone was first unveiled and Apple has marked the occasion with a new iPhone that doesn't just jump one generation, it jumps several. Apple has leapt straight from iPhone 7 (via the¬†iPhone 8, reviewed here) all the way to iPhone 10 (yes, that's how you are supposed to say it).",5
influenster,iphone,"I absolutely love my iPhone X! The camera on this thing is beyond amazing, especially using portrait mode, the pictures come out looking professionally taken. The face recognition is probably my favorite feature; because i loved Touch ID but adding the face recognition made it that much more amazing and convenient. I‚Äôve always been an apple fan; but this is literally my most favorite iPhone I‚Äôve ever owned. 1000000% recommend!",5
influenster,iphone,I absolutely love my new¬† Apple iPhone X ! It's the perfect size even with my little hands. We all know new phones are expensive and this one was a little more pricey but you get so much for your money. The phone took a couple days to get use to but in our world any questions I had about the phone were easily answered on a simple google search. I highly recommend it to any and all of my friends and family!,5
influenster,iphone,"I love my iPhone. Once you go apple, it‚Äôs hard to go to Android. The connectivity is just so helpful and useful. The camera quality of the X is awesome and the functions/features are great. At first, it was difficult to use the phone without the home button, but it‚Äôs definitely easy to get used to!",5
influenster,iphone,My iPhone 6s recently got water damage so I needed to upgrade. I chose to go with the iPhone X because I really liked the fact that it had a larger screen without being the plus. I got used to not having the home screen button pretty quickly!! Love this phone.,5
influenster,iphone,Really good phone. My friend has a phone like this and I fell in love with it. Has good quality camera and it has cool little hacks to it. I also love how big it is. But i kind of dis like that it doesn‚Äôt have a jack to it because if u don‚Äôt have Bluetooth headphones and you need a jack u need to carry another product to just use ur headphones but overall I love it and can over look the no jack thing.,5
influenster,iphone,"Apple‚Äôs iPhone X has a big, beautiful screen, one of the best camera systems you‚Äôll find on a smartphone, fast performance, and wireless charging. Features like the Face ID facial recognition system, used primarily for unlocking the phone and authenticating in apps, genuinely change the way you interact with and use the phone‚Äîusually for the better. It‚Äôs Apple‚Äôs best and most forward-looking iPhone",5
influenster,iphone,"Pros: The face recognition works perfectly, it's a nice size, has a beautiful screen with lovely rich colours, everything works as it should. It has an amazing battery life, with super fast charging. The sound quality from the speakers on the phone is excellent.Cons: No jack port",5
influenster,iphone,"I think this might be my favorite iPhone so far. I like how sleek it looks, the camera is great, the battery lasts a very long time and the face detection is super helpful. I don't like how the back is glass though, because it just ups my chances of it cracking during a fall. I like that they took out the home button; I can't imagine ever going back to having to using a home button.",4
influenster,iphone,My # GiftCrush this season is the IPhone X! If you‚Äôre a person who is in love with electronics and always wanting the newest best products this is the perfect gift to get someone like a significant other. This phone is a little pricey but it‚Äôs because the phone is designed and perfected to work flawlessly for personal and business use! What‚Äôs your #GiftCrush this season?! #Influenster,5
influenster,iphone,"By far, my favorite iPhone to date. The screen size is amazing, while keeping the body of the phone similar to that of an iPhone 8 (not Plus model). The $1000 cost might be out of the price range of some people, but is well worth the price tag. Battery life is astounding, the OLED is bright and vibrant, both the front and rear facing cameras are among the best in the industry.",5
influenster,iphone,"I have a love hate relationship with this phone. When in perfect lighting conditions it can take amazing photos. But normal every day pictures of my kids being kids, are just a blur! It‚Äôs like it can‚Äôt focus! My iPhone 5c took better indoor pictures lol. Ill add a photo I took with it in portrait mode :)",4
influenster,iphone,"The camera quality is splendid. Although, U miss the home button and the 4.7 size. For my petite hands that was the most convenient size. I think it has an improved bisyals, audio and battery time too.",5
influenster,iphone,"I am IN LOVE with my phone. I upgraded from the iPhone 6. It took very little time to get used to all the new features but now I can't think of a reason that a home ""Button"" was ever needed. I have the white one and it looks like a off white/greyish tone which I love SO much, I didn't really want it to be a BRIGHT white. Still on the hunt for a perfect case to go on it... it feels and looks so elegant as is!",5
influenster,iphone,"I really enjoy my X. I thought it would be difficult to get use to the no home screen, but it was fairly easy to get adjusted to. My mom and my brother also did really well adapting to the change too on their own phones. My mom is no techie but she did REALLY well for the knowledge about phones. It‚Äôs easy to learn the new functions and the picture quality is amazing.",5
influenster,iphone,"This phone was everywhere when it first launched, and for good reason too. I mean the price is kinda up there, but they're so techy and nice to use. The animoji feature is so fun. The face recognition to unlock is so easy. At first it was hard to transition over but once you get used to it. It's such a wonderful phone, it takes such nice pictures as well.",4
influenster,iphone,"Just got this baddie for Mother‚Äôs Day and can I just say wow, the screen is beautiful and it all just flows so wonderfully I can‚Äôt get over how great this phone is. I will say that you should invest in a good glass screen protector and case because this thing is all glass so that‚Äôs kinda scary.",5
influenster,iphone,"I actually have the XS, which I upgraded to when my 6s tragically died a watery death. I love love LOVE this phone! The camera is my favorite feature since I do a lot of work on social media. The missing home button didn‚Äôt take long to get used to at all.",5
influenster,iphone,"I love a phone that fits in my small hands and I never upgrade to just get the new best thing. So this was a first...I upgraded just to upgrade. I am not disappointed.¬†The facial recognition is intuitive and fast, camera is upgraded with amazing portrait options and 4K video is a reality. I am just getting into the features but if you are charging me 1200 for a phone, when I could buy a new laptop, it had better live up to expectations and then go beyond.¬†So far my fav feature is the enlarged screen and intuitive lighting. Believe it or not, I can now browse my phone as it dims itself when putting the baby to bed without him getting distracted. Mom win!",5
influenster,iphone,"Apple is life! The products are so user friendly, and the camera is amazing! Apple has created yet another great product. I do feel like since the Apple X is $1000 it should come with the AirPods.",5
influenster,iphone,"I love my iPhone X. It feels like a bigger phone that still fits in my hand. The swipe and face features allow for such fast use, switching between screens and such. There are way less bugs in the iPhone X than I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve gotten in previous iPhones. And the camera is amazing. I love this phone.",5
influenster,iphone,"I am absolutely in love with this phone. The picture quality is great, and I love the 256GB storage option. As someone who keeps a lot of pictures and makes slideshows and minimovies, it definitely comes in handy!¬†It took a while to get used to not having a home button, but after about three days, I didn't even really notice.",5
influenster,iphone,At first I was sad to go to the X cause it meant no more home button. But then I got over it and have never looked back. I enjoy how fast and easy everything it compared to having a home button. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve only had my phone since August but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m satisfied for the time being. Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really see the point in the xr or whatever the newer series are called.,5
influenster,iphone,I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t own this myself but it seems like an awesome product! My friends have it & I really really want it! It has an upgraded camera from what I know & I currently only have the iPhone 7! So I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even have portrait mode!,5
influenster,iphone,Very easy to use! Sleek and the features are amazing. It is worth the high price tag. I love the camera¬† Apple iPhone X t fits easy in my pocket and purse or even a clutch. I had the iPhone 7 Plus but sometimes it was too big,5
influenster,iphone,"By far the greatest iPhone ever invented! Sleek, smart and sexy (until the new ones come out tomorrow - Apple Keynote!) I did however changed the device twice because my battery was draining pretty bad considering it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a brand new phone. Apple staff were super quick to fix it! All I can say is that I cannot live without this phone else I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d be writing reviews on papers (which isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t too bad!)",5
influenster,iphone,This holiday season I wish to get the new iPhone X! I've been wanting a new phone for a while now and hope my family gets it for me! Apple products are personally very easy to use and I say this because I've tried other cellphones besides Apple. I just love the easy navigation through apple and the way its system work! Apple iPhone X,4
influenster,iphone,It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s definitely a good phone. Definitely in my top 5. The screen is very fragile so be careful with it and PLEASE don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be that person that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get a case and a temper glass because you think you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not gonna break it √∞≈∏Àú‚Äö cause you WILL.ZAGG - InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for Apple√Ç¬Æ iPhone√Ç¬Æ 6 Plus and 6s Plus - Clear,5
influenster,iphone,"LOVE it so much more than my old iPhone 7+!!! The feel and aesthetic is just so premium and luxe, I got one for myself and one for my best friend. We both love recording and taking pictures at concerts or for whatever haha. I am super impressed by how they perform and how quickly it is to adjust to the new features and or differences.",5
influenster,iphone,The Apple iPhone X can do so many cool things! It unlocks by face recognition and is so easy to use once you get the hang of it! it's on the expensive side i think it's $31 a month plus other fees and packages. but one thing that bothers me is once or twice it shuts off and doesn't turn back on until an hour later or so.,4
influenster,iphone,"First of all the camera on this product is amazing! The video is so high quality! It you want to vlog on it your footage would be perfect, your instagram pictures will be on fleek, and your snapchats will be popping. But the camera isn't the only good feature in the phone there are many more I totally recommend it to everyone.",5
influenster,iphone,"Got this phone after my 5s so def an upgrade. Its not hard to adjust to the size or the fact that there‚Äôs not a home button. Personally I love the screen! It‚Äôs super long and the resolution is great. I was considering the iPhone 8 before purchasing this one, but I‚Äôm soooooo satisfied with the ten! I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt get the 8!",5
influenster,iphone,Recently purchased the iPhone XS and am very satisfied with the outcome. It‚Äôs a great phone and extremely fast. Only problems I have are pet peeves. Like Face ID not working in landscape mode and the batter percentage not being shown until you go to the command center. Other than that it‚Äôs a great phone and I would recommend.,4
influenster,iphone,I LOVE my X. it has been perfect for me since day one. I have a little girl who likes to play with my phone and it really hasn‚Äôt had any issues. iphones are always expensive BUT totally worth it in my opinion !,5
influenster,iphone,"I like the phone, I know that people say that it glitch‚Äôs but it works just fine. I‚Äôve had the phone x for almost a year and i can say that it hasn‚Äôt glitch on me. Only when there was a software update. Over all I recommend you get this phone. I know it‚Äôs costs a lot but it‚Äôs worth it. So I recommend you get this phone.",5
influenster,iphone,Love my IphoneX! Such a unique phone that feels so great in your hand - the phone itself is so beautiful and really is just seamless - the phone has exceeded my expectations and would recommend anyone thinking about getting it making the jump!,5
influenster,iphone,"I love this phone. It‚Äôs smaller than my 6 plus. It was pricey but I got it anyway. I wish they would‚Äôve kept the storage choices the same. Eliminating the 64g was not the best decision. I wouldn‚Äôt have released the 8 at the same time either. Not the best decision. I love the phone and I am an Apple everything person. MacBook, iPhones, iPads, etc.",5
influenster,iphone,The iPhone X is so user friendly and worth the expense. It is very reliable and the camera takes drastically clearer pictures. I like not having a home button. It eliminates the possibility it could become damaged or stuck. I also like that the screen encompasses the entire phone front. I would highly recommend!,5
influenster,iphone,"For all those I phone lovers our there, you absolutely need to invest in this phone! The batter life is significantly better and the wider screen is an added plus. This phone is waterproof and my favorite feature is the portrait mode on the camera. It literally looks like a professional photograph. Love this phone!",5
influenster,iphone,I love my iPhone¬†X. This was my valentines day gift from my husband and I love it so much. The camera is incredible and It's too much easier to use with the new and amazing features. I love the better and improved face recognition its works great each time. This has got to be my best phone yet. I love it,5
influenster,iphone,What an amazing phone! I just upgraded from an IPhone 7 to and X and it has me floored. It‚Äôs a beautiful design and absolutely wonderful screen clarity! The price was steep but I would say it was worth it. So sleek.,5
influenster,iphone,"Absolutely in love with my new iPhone X. I do not like the price tag, but the features, speed, camera functions are amazing.! i love that it is small like an iPhone 7, yet the screen is that of an iPhone 7 Plus. The sideways cam is too cool with the dual functionality. It does get some getting used to just because the gestures are different and no longer a home button. But more phones now a days no longer have physical button so might as well jump on the band wagon:)",5
influenster,iphone,I'm too excited to get my hands on the news iphone X. Getting it for free that comes with my telecom plan. The 256gb is currently out of stock and I am on waiting list. Hope to get it very soon. I just can't wait!¬†Apple iPhone X¬†I'll will be reviewing the iphone x as soon as I get it.,5
influenster,iphone,I never had this phone before but I would rate this phone full stars because my friend has it and the camera is great. it is reliable and I wish I had it. in my opinion the best feature is everything. I would recommend this to other people if I had it myself. Also this phone can help me with school.,5
influenster,iphone,"I've had iPhones for several years now and have had the X for almost a year.¬† I love it, but I'll be honest I definitely dont use it to its full potential.¬† I forget half the things it does sometimes and end up still using it for the basic functions of internet, phone & texting.",5
influenster,iphone,GREAT PHONE! Amazing capabilities and camera. Portrait mode rocks. Makes taking photos more enjoyable now that the quality is higher and more professional. This phone is great! Can‚Äôt wait to upgrade to the MAX.,5
influenster,iphone,I just want to say a couple things. Yes Apple will always own the fact that they don‚Äôt build the experience around cool new features or technology but they definitely design the experience FIRST and then decide what technology to achieve the result. THIS phone brings great features to the hands of the user in such an intuitive way it was almost hard for me to notice what is new.,5
influenster,iphone,"I‚Äôve had this phone for a week now and I love it. I was die hard Android couldn‚Äôt stand apple products and serious about it. My phone broke last week and the only thing on stock was apple. I figured if I was going apple I was going all the way. I love the screen, colors, and the camera.",5
influenster,iphone,"To be honest, I don‚Äôt like the face recognition as much as I liked the fingerprint. The camera is great, but it drives me crazy that you have to download an app to take a photo large enough to fill the screen. The resolution is great, but the size is the issue I struggle with.",4
influenster,iphone,"The iPhone X has been a great upgrade for me. The Face ID is quickly, response, and offers a great level of security for the phone and secure apps. There is a slight learning curve to the new gestures on the phone, but they end up becoming very natural. You‚Äôll forget about the home button very quickly.",5

influenster,iphone,I just bought the 256GB iPhone Xs in Gold and I am loving it! I upgraded from a 16GB iPhone 6s so the processing is amazingly fast in comparison. Face ID and no home button has been so easy to get used to surprisingly.,5
influenster,iphone,I had this phone since December I love it the face ID is a little difficult sometimes but other than that I really love the phone. I would recommend people who are very tech savvy to but the iphone X.,5
influenster,iphone,I love my new iPhone X it is way better than the other iPhones out now I would not be able to go back to the old one because the iPhone X is more advanced.  The phone also Thales amazing pictures. Apple iPhone X,5
influenster,iphone,Absolutely love APPLE PRODUCTS! I currently have the IPhone X and it has been through so much! I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve dropped it multiple times no cracks on the screen! My son also put my phone in the dogs water bowl for a good 20 seconds fully submerged & it still works! I love my IPhone X! :) <3,5
influenster,iphone,I absolutely love this phone. I am a long time apple user and this phone is my favorite yet! I love that there are less buttons and it is almost bezel-less. I was worried about the Face ID as someone who wears contacts and glasses but it recognizes me no matter what.,4
influenster,iphone,"Honestly, the best phone ever! Love love love portrait mode! Very easy to use, light weight and if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not a fan of the plus size - but still want a good phone get this one! I encourage everyone to have it!",5
influenster,iphone,I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not sure why everyone was so against the X. I get that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s super pricey but that aside its amazing. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had mine since they came out and I love it so much. The camera is definitely my favorite part!,5
influenster,iphone,"I love my iPhone X, its full screen and does the face unlock. Camera quality is the best. I am my very own photographer. Price is high on these phones but I know its worth it. I've never had a problem with any of my Apple products! You will LOVEEEE!!!!!!!",5
influenster,iphone,I love Apple so much. I have never had Samsung or Android. No judgement against them but Apple is my favorite. I love the glass back and the double vertical camera. While ¬†the X/10 is expensive it is totally worth it. Amazing phone and I love mine.,5
influenster,iphone,"i didn‚Äôt think i would like this phone coming from a 7+ because it‚Äôs smaller. however the size is perfect for your hands! a little expensive, but the camera on this thing is better than my DSLR... so if you like to take photos & your on the fence GET IT!",5
influenster,iphone,Personally I wouldn‚Äôt recommend specially not for 1000 does everything any other phone could do for way less.ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è luckily camera is still one of the best overall apple give me something someone hasn‚Äôt already done Wouldn‚Äôt recommend to a friend,3
influenster,iphone,Very addicting phone. You never want to put it down. The facial recognition is extremely convenient and easy to get used to. It doesn‚Äôt feel as heavy as it looks either. Small enough to fit in your back pocket snug and beautiful camera quality.,5
influenster,iphone,"Absolutely in love with the bigger screen, camera, and new ios features. I recently switched from android to apple so I don‚Äôt know how the x compares to say the 8 or a 7, but my apps run much smoother and I‚Äôm impressed by the length of battery.",5
influenster,iphone,Just got this phone last week and it‚Äôs amazing! I love the emoji active feature and how there‚Äôs no home button! They also have so many new features locked into this phone. My battery lasts forever!!! I highly recommend even though it‚Äôs pricey!,5
influenster,iphone,I LOVE my iPhone X. It runs smoothly and the optics are perfection. Face ID is so convenient when I have dirty hands I don‚Äôt have to worry about my fingerprints not reading. It‚Äôs got a good steady weight to it and the camera is the absolutely best yet.,5
influenster,iphone,"The best iPhone that has come out this far! The camera is amazing and I love the Face ID aspect, it makes everything that much easier! I have doing the phone plan through Apple and got such a better deal in comparison to my Verizon carrier.",5
influenster,iphone,"I was torn between the X and the 8 for quite some time, but I'm so glad I went for the X! The battery life is great and I love all the new updates. I don't even miss the home button! I also don't have that many problems with the face ID",5
influenster,iphone,"I‚Äôve been with the Apple family for awhile and this product exceeded my expectations. I made sure once they announced it to preorder ASAP. I love the convenience of Face ID, Animoji, Apple Pay, and etc. A great phone definitely worth the money. I have a review via YouTube of this product.",5
influenster,iphone,"I love the phone, but does have some issue even when I update it, such as an issue I am having right now which I have had in the past, I do not get notifications. I have tried everything to fix the issue and it still keeps happening.",4
influenster,iphone,I currently have this phone and I think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the best iPhone that has ever been out it is so easy to do the things you love and the camera is amazing it is expensive but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s something you can splurge on and I think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s worth it,5
influenster,iphone,Great update from the iPhone 8! The camera is better than most digital cameras currently on the market. The larger screen makes it easier to read and video watching is seamless. The iOS system is fast and is completely intuitive.,4
influenster,iphone,"I love my iPhone X. I was concerned about missing the home button, but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m pleased with how fluid they made the functions. The Face ID unlocks my phone much quicker than the thumbprint scanner. And the photo quality is amazing!",5
influenster,iphone,Really love this phone! I have had it for a while now and I keep finding out more and more things out about it that I love! My favorite part is the Face ID. I love that it is a really sleek design and looks supper high quality!,5
influenster,iphone,I rate this product a 5 because it has really good reviews and I really want one. I feel like the best feature on the iPhone X would be the new camera. This phone is a bit pricey for an iPhone but I feel like it may be worth it.,5
influenster,iphone,"I absolutely love this phone, I love the Face ID feature, the quality of the camera is amazing, love the portrait feature, the size of the phone is just right, not too big, not too small, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s very expensive but worthwhile.",5
influenster,iphone,"I have been in love with all Apple products for quite some time now, and this one doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t disappoint! I love how it feels in my hand and how the screen takes up the whole front of the phone. It is pricey, but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s worth it.",5
influenster,iphone,I want to get this as gift for myself I need a phone  √∞≈∏‚Äú¬≤ I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wait to get for myself √∞≈∏Àú‚Ç¨√∞≈∏Àú‚Ç¨√∞≈∏Àú∆í√∞≈∏Àú∆í i just love apple products  I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve seen all of review on it I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wait to get for Christmas √∞≈∏≈Ω‚Äû does anyone else like the iPhone X ? #GiftCrush √∞≈∏‚Äú¬≤√∞≈∏‚Äú¬≤√∞≈∏‚Äú¬≤√∞≈∏‚Äú¬≤√∞≈∏‚Äú¬≤√∞≈∏‚Äú¬≤√∞≈∏‚Äú¬≤√∞≈∏‚Äú¬≤,5
influenster,iphone,I love my IPhone X!! The speed is amazing and I have plenty of storage on my on phone. The camera is way better then any previous models. I do believe the price tag is to heavy though.¬† Apple iPhone X,5
influenster,iphone,"I love my iPhone. First, it took me a while to get used to not having a home button, but it is great not having one. I love the camera so much and the battery lasts really long.¬† Apple iPhone X",5
influenster,iphone,I haven‚Äôt gotten this phone but I know others who have. The simple fact is the technology these days are so advanced and it‚Äôs fascinating that a phone unlocks to the face of the phones keeper. I hope that one day I can get one!,5
influenster,iphone,Okay. I am on the side of the Apple followers. But when it comes to this new iPhone I‚Äôm just not a huge fan. I don‚Äôt really like the fact that there‚Äôs no more home button. I prefer the older versions for sure!,4
influenster,iphone,"I love my IPhone X, for the longest time I wanted a bigger screen but hated how big the IPhone plus was and that I have small hands. I love that the iPhone X is the same size as the IPhone 8 but with a larger screen.",5
influenster,iphone,My husband recently bought this phone and it‚Äôs great. I like the new features and it takes perfect crisp clear pictures. I have the iPhone 7 and happy with it. I‚Äôm definitely going to upgrade come due time.,5
influenster,iphone,This phone is seriously incredible!! I upgraded from the iPhone 6s straight to this phone and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. I‚Äôve wanted the Apple iPhone X ever since the rumors had started coming out and now I have it. The camera is absolutely incredible and I use it almost every day. The main reason I was in love with this phone is the look and the screen. The OLED display is so bright and clear especially compared to my old iPhone 6s. I don‚Äôt regret my purchase one bit and I am extremely happy to have gotten this phone. Its the perfect fit for my hand and I don‚Äôt sacrifice screen size for the overall size of the phone. I get the plus size screen with the phone size of a normal iPhone.,5
influenster,iphone,"I bought the Iphone X a couple months after it came@out and wasn‚Äôt fully happy with it, i‚Äôve been an apple fan since the first one came out and this one to me was their worst.. slow, froze so many times",3
influenster,iphone,I LOVE the new look to the iPhone. I want one so bad. It‚Äôs so beautiful. I love how there‚Äôs no home button. The quality on the phones camera is just out of this world. I would recommend this to others.,5
influenster,iphone,I‚Äôve had the iPhone X for about 2 months now and absolutely love it! Finally Apple has come to the upgraded technology of today. I love the full touch screen and facial recognition features and the sound is so much louder than earlier models! The camera quality is amazing and it has really cool features hidden inside! I see many improvements going forward like removing the notch on the top or making larger models and even putting a fingerprint sensor on the touchscreen but that is for future models.,5
influenster,iphone,"Not only is this one of the coolest and best iPhone ever, but it is quiet expensive. Regardless of price, the iPhone X is amazing at photos, playing games, and doing internet browsing on a big screen.",5
influenster,iphone,"This phone its self is amazing my dad has it and¬† I love it , I try to get on it every chance I get I¬† love love LOVE the phone its amazing the way it looks and the way it takes pictures it is so nice and amazing I love it ITS TO DIE FOR I WOULD TREADE IT IN FOR ANYTHING",5
influenster,iphone,I love my iPhone X! It was a little pricey but totally worth all of the convenience features! I love the face recognition. Face recognition is even used when accessing my credit cards or auto filling my passwords.,5
influenster,iphone,I would love to get this. I love that it is slightly smaller than my iPhone 7plus yet the screen is bigger. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s amazing. I also love the face unlock feature. I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wait to be able to charge my phone wirelessly.,5
influenster,iphone,I actually I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m new to iPhone Shocker! So my first new real iPhone is the iPhone XR I got the coral one and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m pleasantly pleased and surprised how easy and fast it was to get it up and running.,5
influenster,iphone,Amazing product apple created here. The picture resolution is amazing so you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even need a professional camera which makes your life less expensive. Easy to use at any age. Highly recommend,5
influenster,iphone,"This is actually my favorite phone that apple has came up with! I bought me and my boyfriend one and we can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t live without it. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s great, durable and water proof! Everything you can ask for!",5
influenster,iphone,"I love my iPhone X, however I do find that the changes to the iOS system and the changes to how you open and close apps, or how you screenshot differently do take some time to get used too.",4
influenster,iphone,I love my iPhone X. Took some getting use to without having a home button but I love it. The camera quality is amazing √∞≈∏Àú¬ª and the new picture functions help capture those perfect memories!,5
influenster,iphone,I really love my iPhone X. At first I was unsure of all the different changes because of not having a button anymore but I have no issues! I got it when it was fairly new still and I did have a few issues getting out of particular apps but the update has fixed that already! I love that it recognizes my face to get into password protected apps and websites! It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so handy and it keeps my security when I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not near my phone so no one can read my notifications! It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s super fast and the camera is honestly better than my dslr sometimes!!! I love it!,5
influenster,iphone,I would love to review this product and give detailed information about the product. I've heard so many good things about this phone and would like to talk more in depth about it,5
influenster,iphone,I love my iPhone X. The most important thing for me to love was the camera and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s exceptional. I use many cameras at my disposal and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m glad my phone camera is amazing.,5
influenster,iphone,"I love i phones thru  make my busy life easier. I love,the,color. Even though I do not own an i phone I would most definently love to have this one.  Apple iPhone X",5
influenster,iphone,I really need a new iPhone and this is perfect for a new iPhone present for myself and this is the new phone that I always wanted and this phone so good and I love this phone and wanted to use this for things that are important!,5
influenster,iphone,"Like all Apple products this is wonderful. An unparalleled design, elegant, practical, simple but beautiful. The potential of this intelligent slide makes it the best #GiftCrush for this Christmas.",5
influenster,iphone,"It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s alright, I like it more than other iPhones I have had in the passed but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s only upside is better speakers and the pled display, all other features are the same as all the other phones",5
influenster,iphone,"Have had my iPhone X since January and I absolutely LOVE it! The camera quality is amazing, so many beautiful photos with portrait mode as well! Definitely recommend √∞≈∏Àú≈†",5
influenster,iphone,Ok so I was skeptical at first with the new Face ID and the screen change.  I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a die hard Apple fan and I put off getting the iPhone X because I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t too sure that I would care for it but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in love.  I love the new portrait editing that it has and it takes amazing video and photos.  I love the comfort of holding in my hand.  I think the plus was just slightly too big and I found that I dropped my phone frequently.  This phone fits nicely in my hand.  The quality of video (watching) is much better than the previous phones.  I tried the Face ID with my eye closed and it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t unlock.  I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve tried it on my kids too whom do have a resemblance to me and it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t unlock for them either.  All in all I have to say it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a great phone and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m glad I made the upgrade.,5
influenster,iphone,"This is such a great new device for anybody who is willing to learn new features and gestures to get the most out of technology. The design is so sleek and gorgeous too! It's similar to the 8, but with a better camera",5
influenster,iphone,"Best iPhone ever!!! Yo ten√É¬≠a el iPhone 7p y se lo termin√É¬© regalando a mi esposo porque era muy grande y sent√É¬≠a que la tecnolog√É¬≠a no era muy adelantada, adem√É¬°s de q solo ten√É¬≠a 32g de memoria√∞≈∏Àú‚Äò. Tuve un tiempo con el galaxy 8, no es un mal tel√É¬©fono pero cuando vi la c√É¬°mara y la calidad de las fotos decid√É¬≠ volver a Apple y no me arrepiento. Tengo el ecosistema completa y para grabar mis tutoriales, fotos de mis maquillajes ect es lo mejor.",5
influenster,iphone,"I am one of those don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fix it if it ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t broken type of people so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been holding on to my Apple iPhone 6s Plus without upgrading because it did its job. It took a crap a few months ago so I finally upgraded to the Apple iPhone X. I am so glad I waited to upgrade to this one because it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s amazing! The screen is just about as big as my Plus was with the edge to edge screen, but the phone itself is smaller so it actually fits in my pockets. The camera quality is beyond superb and I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll ever need a regular camera again. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so multi functional that it was definitely worth the hefty price tag. I highly recommend it for anyone needing an upgrade!",5
influenster,iphone,"Love this phone! The camera is amazing and the technology can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be topped.If you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re looking for a new phone in the new year, this is it! Although, it is expensive... but worth it! I like to think about it as a personal investment.",5
influenster,iphone,"The product is very well adapted. I think that for it to be a 10 year anniversary device, Apple really outdid themselves. Affordability was a tad unattainable but if you can, it is very easy to use. I would definitely recommend the device to a friend. There are so many neat added features to this device, that have not been on previous devices, that make the iPhone X unlike the rest! Anyone looking for a new cellular device to exceed your games, internet or photography needs in life; the iPhone X is the way to go!",4
influenster,iphone,I love this phone so much.i have this phone right now and I think it‚Äôs amazing. It is very expensive but it‚Äôs worth it. It is very reliable.it takes longer to charge but oh doesn‚Äôt run out of battery easily.,5
influenster,iphone,Hello I came according your product and I wanted to see if this product is as great as it says! I want to test and promote this product for everyone! Please let me test and review,5
influenster,iphone,"I looooove my new IPhone X! It honestly is the best phone I‚Äôve had in gosh.... uh EVER!? Yeah. It has so many cool feature on it. It‚Äôs not too big and it‚Äôs not too small. It‚Äôs a big larger than the 8 but smaller than the plus sizes. The camera is absolutely incredible and has a portrait mode setting that makes it seems like you‚Äôve suddenly become a professional photographer overnight üòú I don‚Äôt mind. It have the home button, you get used too it! Love this phone so much! Apple iPhone X",5
influenster,iphone,"I like this phone very much! It‚Äôs a very advanced piece of technology. I love the photos it takes, the Animojis endlessly entertain me, and I find that some of the tools and features are very useful. The one thing that I don‚Äôt like so much on it is that every time I want to open my phone, I have to look at it (which really does sound lazy, but I just don‚Äôt like waiting for it to recognize me). Other than that though, I highly recommend getting it if you‚Äôre into this new technology.",4
influenster,iphone,"This phone is amazing!! It takes the BEST photos. You can rely on this phone to take amazing pictures!! When you first get the phone, it's pretty confusing but you'll get the hang of it. I totally recommend getting this phone!! #iphonex #phone #amazing  #techie",5
influenster,iphone,This phone is pretty snazzy üòÇ The camera quality is so clearüòçüòç And btw face I'd is nothing newüòÇ they just have way better face idüòÇ the battery is decent and the display is amazing üòç it should be more affordable though üòÇ but overall an amazing phone üëèüëèüëè,4
influenster,iphone,I HADDDDD to have this phone! I mean I get every phone!!! I should have gotten then 8 instead! I mean don‚Äôt get me wrong the phone good....NOT WORTH The price but good! I could do without the Face ID..I need my fingerprint back! Back camera is AMAZING...front camera not so much! screen is great!! That‚Äôs one feature that I love!! And the phone is too small!! Coming from an Plus to a...idk what to call this! I always use autocorrect ü§£ü§£ü§£,4
influenster,iphone,"For starters, look at these photos. This camera is to die for! The focus is incredible! I love this phone so much! It‚Äôs the best! It took a second to adjust to the new controls but so far, no complaints at all! Why? Because it‚Äôs Apple and they‚Äôre the greatest!",5
influenster,iphone,"This phone is amazing! I recently upgraded from an iPhone 6S plus and I‚Äôm so happy I did! The camera is awesome, the speakers are LOUD, and the graphics are sweet. There‚Äôs lots of cool little features also. It‚Äôs on the more expensive side but overall it‚Äôs a great phone for the price!",5
influenster,iphone,"I love this phone so much. I woke up at 1:50am to preorder this phone and I waited in line the day it came out. I have yet to have an issue with this phone. It has a great camera, screen resolution and let‚Äôs not mention Face ID. I would recommend this to anyone, even you Android users.",5
influenster,iphone,"Apple‚Äôs 10th anniversary iPhone X sets a new gold standard for the next decade of iPhones. Coming hot on the heels of the iPhone 8¬†and¬†iPhone 8 Plus¬†the¬†iPhone X¬†steals the show despite sharing nearly identical internal hardware. The X (pronounced ‚Äúten‚Äù) is a beautiful, modern sculpture, and iPhone owners finally have a reason to show off their phones again.",5
influenster,iphone,I am a die hard iPhone user. I started with the iPhone 4 and have been hooked ever since. I recently upgraded to the iPhone X. I have the iPhone forever plan through Sprint. I love the ease of use and the options to send payments through text messages. My only complaint is that the screen is extremely fragile. Within a day of receiving the phone I noticed a hairline scratch.,4
influenster,iphone,I have had this phone for a month now and i must say that it is my favorite iPhone ever !!! I loved the size of my plus but where the screen is the same size i don‚Äôt notice a huge difference and i think I like the overall size of this phone better. I think it‚Äôs a very professional and adult looking phone as well. The camera is great and i love not having a home button !!!,5
influenster,iphone,"I would love to get an Iphone so badly. I believe that this phone would be a huge step up from the phone that I have. If you're thinking about getting someone a new phone as a gift, then you should definetly get this product. It is literally the best phone of the year. If I could get one, I know I would get this one without a doubt. Go Apple iPhone X",5
influenster,iphone,In one word the most amazing phone ever. So first things first the phone unlocks with your face and another person won‚Äôt be able to see your notifications unless you show your phone your face. The design is extraordinary and very beautiful and best feature of it is the Animoji.,5
influenster,iphone,"So, my boyfriend has this phone and of course I spent a few days consumed with it and seeing all of its new features. Needless to say, a lot of impressive upgrades. But, I can't get over the fact that there isn't a home button. Whatever Apple does next, they should include a button somewhere.",3
influenster,iphone,I‚Äôm a huge fan of Apple and all of their products. I started out with Apple before they even had the iPod Touch and I‚Äôve stuck with them since then. I currently have the iPhone X and it‚Äôs fantastic. The facial ID works better than I imagined and not having a home button hasn‚Äôt been a problem. It‚Äôs a lot of money but great to have.,5
influenster,iphone,"When I first got this phone, I was disappointed in the size. To be honest, I thought my 7 Plus was better and I would wish I kept it. The more I used it and realized all the features it has, I began using the phone to its potential. Now, I can't go back to any phone with the exception of the new iPhone X + (plus) lol.. :)",5
influenster,iphone,I love this phone. I have had and iPhone since I don't know how long and they have later. My iPhone x has a wonderful camera quality and is amazing. I highly recommend for anyone because it is very easy to use and I just love it so so much.,5
influenster,iphone,So far this phone is really good. I like the updated screen with crisp clear images and graphics. I like how the camera is and gives more features and the memory they have on this phone is a step up then the older iPhones. I also like how it is different in technology. But again the price is a tad more then the older iPhones,5
influenster,iphone,"Jumped from the iPhone 6s to the iPhone X and I am in love. The camera is just amazingly amazing, the phone is very slim so easy to fit inside my purse and there is so much space!! I love everything about the phone, from the screen to the way the apps are displayed to the face recognition ID. Perfect, highly recommend.",5
influenster,iphone,When my original phone was acting up I was debating on the 8 or the x. I went to apple and started playing around with them and I fell in love with the x. It‚Äôs easier to use then I thought the camera is amazing and it‚Äôs the perfect size. If you are tired of your phone and are looking to get this would I recommend it 100%,5
influenster,iphone,Received this item on launch day and I haven‚Äôt had any issues with this phone. My favorite part about the phone is the facial recognition. I was tired of using my fingerprint for everything. I would totally recommend this phone.,5
influenster,iphone,I would love to have an IPhone X because I have had really good experiences with Apple in tge past and I just overall in general love apple and their design and apps and just everyrhing all about them. The only thing that I dont like is that its missing google and YouTube but you can easily just download those on there,4
influenster,iphone,"I would definitely recommend buying it! If you are interested in it you can get it at the nearest Apple store! It has tons of new features such as Animoji and exclusive backgrounds! I personally think that it is better than the Samsung phones! Again, I totally recommend buying it no doubt!Apple iPhone Xüòä",5
influenster,iphone,"I‚Äôm really liking the iPhone X. The face recognition function is pretty neat and convenient. At first it wasn‚Äôt easy to adjust to not having a middle button but after a week, I no longer missed it. There‚Äôs not too many changes but I do like that it‚Äôs much smaller and thinner than the iPhone 7 Plus.",5
influenster,iphone,"This thing looks amzing!!! I really wanna try it out, so i could tell everyone how great it is, and make them buy it.¬† This phone is just to exspensive for me, so sadly, i will never get my hands on it. On my yt channel, if i ever do get it (i doubt it), i would say al the great things.",5
influenster,iphone,"I really like the Apple products, and I am the person that is so excited about to be fashionable. I payed $1000 plus taxes, I think it is expensive but once again I was surprised by the photo quality that in my opinion the Apple is the best and now with the resistance that IPhone X has.",5
influenster,iphone,"i love my new phone so much! i know it's a bit pricey, but i promise it makes every dollar worth it. the face recognition is occasionally unreliable, but it is pretty cool and all my friends would agree. the camera quality is amazing and i wouldn't trade this phone for anything.",5
influenster,iphone,"I love my IPhone X, but I guess I got bad luck. Mine gets overheated just watching videos. It shuts down on its own and it‚Äôs a scratch magnet! On the other hand, it has a beautiful look, feel, and hardware. I do wish it came in gold. It has an amazing camera with fun features.",4
influenster,iphone,I love all my Apple products. The only downside I have to this phone is the battery life! I love that the screen is large. The facial recognition is great with very few times it doesn‚Äôt register my face. The home button was a challenge for me a few days but now it‚Äôs routine.,4
influenster,iphone,"I got the Iphone X as soon as it came out! BEST DECISION EVER!!! I love the face ID and being able to just look at the screen to make purchases, etc. It took some getting used to since there is not a home button, but now I can't imagine going back to having a home button.",5
influenster,iphone,I love apple products and i bought this phone becuase i needed an upgrade and this phone is the best it hold so much memories i love the quality of the camera it takes the best pictures and videos,5
influenster,iphone,The best thing of this iPhone is the portrait mode of pictures. It can be a bit frustrating because face recognition is harder than it looks. It doesn‚Äôt verify that much at night or if its on a desk and you lean over the desk it will not recognize you. It literally needs to be in-front of your face.,5
influenster,iphone,"So I got this because my spouse raced on how great it was. Granted it has some cool features but the price is ridiculous. It has face recognition which is cool, but the phone itself is super slippery. The phone falls all the time so make sure you get a good case for it.",4
influenster,iphone,This is amazing. I upgraded to this one IPhone X. I used to have IPhone 7 Plus. And I got used to it. It meet my expectations and it‚Äôs absolutely fabulous. It doesn‚Äôt have any limitation. There is no need for anything in this phone than just rock and enjoy the features.,5
influenster,iphone,This is the best iPhone I have ever owed and I have owned everyone of them except for the 8  I highly recommend on getting the iPhone X or as other people call it the iPhone 10,5
influenster,iphone,"I am so happy with this phone, I gave my daughter my 7 plus and the size difference was weird to me at first but I actually really love it! It‚Äôs fast, I love the memory space, and the overall quality of the phone is great. I‚Äôm definitely IPhone for life üòç",5
influenster,iphone,At first I didn‚Äôt think I was gonna like this phone but I was wrong!! The price is high but yeah!! I love everything about it!! It‚Äôs easy to use not complicated no issues at all!! I would recommend if your an Apple user and can afford it!! Get one!!,5
influenster,iphone,Love this phone! The photo quality is amazing! I got the 256GB so I could have more room (even though I don‚Äôt need it lol). Still trying to get use to the no home button but definitely love this phone!,5
influenster,iphone,"I want this new iPhone so badly! Not only is the facial recognition top of the line, I love the fact that it comes with a charging pad instead of a physical charger! And who isn‚Äôt excited about the talking emoji ability?!",5
influenster,iphone,This is my all time favorite product. I will never find anything that compares to it. I would be so grateful if I could get PR packages of this product so I could review for the people on my social media pages! It would get you more sales! I can‚Äôt stress enough how much I love this product!,5
influenster,iphone,People complain about it having no home button and just has face recognition instead of fingerprint but honestly it's really better than any of previous ones in my opinion. I like it.,5
influenster,iphone,"Best iPhone yet! I have had it for several months now and have nothing to complain about. Perfect size, tons of storage, super fast, amazing camera, and just COOL! I know it‚Äôs expensive but... it‚Äôs worth it.",5
influenster,iphone,Apple iPhone X is my #giftcrush. I have an iPhone 7 and don‚Äôt really like the camera and I have heard the iPhone X has a great camera which is the main reason I use my phone. Some day.....,4
influenster,iphone,This is definitely my #giftcrush!!! I would love yo have this phone. It's gorgeous and I love just looking at my bestfriends iPhone X....the picture quality and everything about it is AMAZING.,5
influenster,iphone,"Okay so I was really hoping to get this iPhone X! Why I was hoping to get it is because, it's the newest trend!!! and I have been using an ipod touch for awhile now. So and upgrade would be neat!!! ‚ô°  Apple iPhone X",4
influenster,iphone,My friend has this phone and it is amazing. It has very good camera quality. The best feature would probably be the animoji¬†it is very fun to play with them,5
influenster,iphone,"I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. The phone is super fast, the screen is brilliant, and Apple offers a great 0% interest financing plan that includes Apple care. The camera is also amazing, I steal it from him all the time!  Apple iPhone X",5
influenster,iphone,By far my favorite iPhone! Getting used to the face detection to unlock sucks and first but once you get it you love it so much more than the thumb or the code!,5
influenster,iphone,"Well I have the IPhone XR, and the camera quality is very good. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not use to the face lock but it is convenient if you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to press the home button.",5
influenster,iphone,I love my phone √∞≈∏‚Äô≈° it took some getting used to but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m used to it and wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have it another way. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so cute though I wished it came in different colors,5

influenster,iphone,I would like to say that I would love to have this phone so when you get into your phone you can get in your phone with your face. Yes it‚Äôs easy to use but you have to get a good case for it.yes it meet all of the requirements.yes others should buy the new phone.,5
influenster,iphone,"Just got my X for $400 off at Verizon on black Friday and I am over the moon about it.¬† The OLED screen really makes all the difference! I didn't think I would like Face ID, but it is convenient because it's so accurate - it can recognize me with and without makeup and glasses.¬† It's not that much bigger overall than a 6, which is what I switched from, but the screen is considerably larger.¬† This is a huge plus for me and I think it will be to other women with small hands!¬† I didn't want to get anything bigger because I have a feeling I would drop it all the time.¬† The camera is hands down the best feature on this phone.¬† Portrait mode works great, works well in low light, and makes pictures look professional.¬† I would get this while you can still get your hands on it at a discounted price, because it's already being discontinued by Apple in order for them to force you to pay for the XS in order to get the dual lens camera and OLED screen.¬† Would I pay $1000 for this? No way, but $500? Sure thing.",4
influenster,iphone,Best iPhone made!! I love that it‚Äôs easy to navigate. It‚Äôs sleek and a cute accessory for any fashionista.,5
influenster,iphone,I got this for my son for his birthday. He is very happy with it. He prefers apple over android products. I would recommend this.,5
influenster,iphone,"Amazing phone, once again an improvement on the last iPhone model that I had and was very happy with. The sound is much improved (louder & clearer speakers) and the face recognition is something that I don't know how  I will ever be able to live without in a phone now having had it- it's amazing. The camera is the big hit, it takes phenomenal photos with great editing options. The only downside is that as with all iPhones I've had, the screen is not too hard to crack so definitely invest in a good case and/or Sapphire glass or similar to cover it with. Note that this phone operates right to the very edges with regard to swiping actions and so forth so make sure that the protective case you choose allows for you to utilize that or it will be a bit frustrating at times. I have the Otterbox Pursuit & like it very much, the wrist strap comes in handy as well. Initially I had the Otterbox Defender which worked fine, but prefer the slimmer body, easier access to edges of screen and as mentioned, the wrist strap features of the Otterbox Pursuit. Back to the phone- an easy 5/5 stars! Apple iPhone X",5
influenster,iphone,I just got this phone as a Christmas gift and it is a GAME CHANGER!! It‚Äôs extremely easy to use. I thought the home button being gone would be problematic for me but it‚Äôs not at all! The facial recognition is great so I don‚Äôt have to type in my phone passcode every time. My favorite feature has gotta be the camera though. I‚Äôm obsessed with portrait mode for taking pictures of my little girl. With the combination of cool photo apps like Tintype or Vsco cam I can make great memories. üòç,5
influenster,iphone,"I bought this phone right when it was first released. it was very expensive, so I have been extremely careful to not crack my phone---as I would have to pay hefty consequences for doing so. I guess in my opinion, the photos have been great. I mainly use my phone for social media so it was important to me to make sure the product is fit for my necessities.",4

influenster,iphone,"I really do love this phone. I will admit, I do have a soft spot for apple, but I think apple blew it out of the park with this phone. The edge to edge display really makes the viewing experience amazing and Face ID is really accurate. One thing I do miss is the Touch ID, but if you had this phone for a while. You sorta forget that was even an option. The camera is amazing for photos and videos. It's very crisp and sometimes makes the picture even more beautiful than what it was in real life. I would definitely recommend this phone to everyone!",5
influenster,iphone,"The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, yet one that really paid off six months into our testing. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got.",5

influenster,iphone,"I was coming from an iPhone 6 Plus originally that just so happened to have screen damage the month I paid it off (typical) so instead of getting it repaired, I reverted back to my iPhone 5 (regular) and said I'd wait for the next release. Since the X was announced alongside the 8/8 Plus, I opted to wait even longer for the X and I'm glad I did. The look of the phone is top notch and the quality is definitely solid. Keep in mind I'm coming from something much older where the quality standards, while high at the time, pail in comparison to today's iPhone.I've had the iPhone X for six days now and don't even remember what using that Home button (that I've been using since the iPhone 3GS) is like. You'll forget it soon enough, too. The gestures are still very natural. I always hated how large the Plus model felt in my hands as doing anything ""one-handed"" was impossible, even using reachability. I feel that the X is a great balance between the non-Plus models and the Plus models and I did turn on reachability (it is turned off by default) to help reach some of the upper portions of the screen as I like using the phone one-handed.Next to my wife's iPhone 7 Plus, the screen size is virtually the same between the two, while the X's form factor is overall smaller, which is real nice. The ""notch"" along the top edge of the screen isn't an issue for me, as it seems to be for some. Within time, third-party apps will adopt the new resolution and everything will be seamless when switching applications. I have no qualms about the display's brightness either, as I find myself setting it to the lowest setting quite frequently. It's very bright! The only con I would give for the screen is that the refresh rate is lower than I expected, as I sometimes catch the screen flicker slightly with the naked eye as the oLED refreshes.I've never had Touch ID, so I cannot legitimately compare it to Face ID, but I can say that Face ID is very quick and intuitive. It was easy to setup and can be reset easily if desired. With Face ID, if there are notifications present and someone picks up your phone, they can only see what app is pushing the notification. The instance they hand the phone to you and you look at it, the specific notifications populate fully, which is nice if you're getting a text message that is for your eyes only. The only con (if you would call it that) I would give for Face ID is if your phone is sitting on a flat surface (such as a desk) and you're sitting next to it, your face is not within range of the sensor, so you have to either move into view/lift the phone into view, or enter the backup passcode to unlock the device.The speed is blazingly fast compared to my previous phones by far, while the battery life smashes any other iPhone I've had. I haven't charged it wirelessly so can't comment on that. I'll likely wait until Apple releases their own charging pad so I can use it with my Apple Watch. The sound output kinda blew me away too, as I've been finding myself turning it down, when I'm used to turning it up in the past. I don't care that they dropped the audio jack, as it's a wireless world we live in today. Thankfully for those of you who do require the audio jack, they include a Lightning to 3.5mm dongle adapter. As far as the camera, I was able to take amazing photos at a car show over the weekend, and the 4K video is stunningly crisp and smooth with it's dual stabilizing camera sensors. I'm in love with my phone again, and it's been awhile.The price I feel is fair in today's market. Yes, I paid $150 extra for the 256GB, but feel it's still very much worth the up-charge when the base only comes with 64GB. Photos, songs and videos add up quick, not to mention apps. The payment plan with your carrier makes it a little easier to swallow, and isn't much more than what my iPhone 6 Plus cost monthly back when it was new.I recommend Apple Care Protection, which can be purchased separately up to 60 days after original purchase date. Get a phone cover and screen protector on-the-double! Best Buy has many options available and I bought both a moderate, slimline cover and a durable, more bulky cover, as well as a glass screen protector. You'll want to protect this investment for sure.In short, if you've been holding out for three (or more) years like me, then this is definitely the iPhone you want to get. You will not be disappointed!",5
influenster,iphone,"It‚Äôs pretty good as iPhones go, not much different from older models the screen quality is very clear and good for watching videos, screen is big and easy to use and the Face ID is great and really works, the only thing I hate is the Apple Pay feature I much preferred the Touch ID function as it was so easy or using passcode but the double tap feature is pretty bad.",4
influenster,iphone,"I've had my iPhoneX for a few months now and honestly all the new features are amazing such as the face recognition, battery life, screen and camera,¬†but there are some setbacks which i didn't expect, unlike other iphones in the past with this one in order to close an application you cant just swipe up like before you need to hold on the app and wait for an 'X' to show and then you close them one by one which is pretty frustrating, another setback is the lag it has. my phone suddenly just freezes and then turns off, and then i need to reopen the phone again. OH!! and last thing, the face recognition only recognizes you when you're sitting up straight so it needs a bit of an effort if you're¬†just laying in bed, it's during these times where you start to miss your finger recognition.",4

influenster,iphone,"he iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, but one that really paid off. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got.¬†The OLED display goes a long way in making amends for these quibbles. The 5.8-inch screen has a 2,436 x 1,125-pixel resolution (458 pixels per inch), and it‚Äôs razor sharp. Colors are vibrant, blacks are finally as pitch-dark as many other OLED Android phones, and it was easy to read in direct sunlight. ¬†You‚Äôll have a hard time pulling your eyes away from this screen.¬†As on the iPhone 8 and iPad, Apple‚Äôs True Tone technology detects the lighting condition you‚Äôre in, and adjusts the screen‚Äôs tint to make it more readable. It works extremely well, and made the screen warmer ‚Äî and easier on the eyes ‚Äî in our harsh office lighting.The phone‚Äôs all-glass rear is almost the same as the iPhone 8 Plus, except the dual-camera setup has turned to a vertical orientation. Apple says the front-facing depth sensors and cameras took up a lot of space up top, and the rear camera wouldn‚Äôt fit sideways. With only the Apple and iPhone logo printed on the glass, the back looks minimal and sleek. The vertical orientation is a dead giveaway you have the iPhone X, as it‚Äôs a pretty unusual camera orientation and placement on a phone.One noticeable difference is the power button, which now perhaps should be called the ‚Äúlock button.‚Äù Still situated on the right edge, it‚Äôs more elongated than before, which makes it easier to find and press. We say lock button because to turn off the iPhone X, you need to press the lock button and the volume up or down buttons. Tapping on the lock button just wakes or turns off your screen, but you can double tap it to activate Apple Pay, or press and hold it to launch Siri.The mute switch is on the top left, and the volume rocker sits below. There‚Äôs still no headphone jack, and the only port is for your Lightning cable at the bottom edge, between the bottom-firing speakers. For music, you‚Äôll either have to pair wireless earbuds with the¬†Bluetooth 5 technology¬†on board, or you can embrace the dongle life with the included Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter.What I like most about the iPhone X is its size. It feels compact ‚Äî it‚Äôs slightly larger than the 4.7-inch iPhone 8, but it has a bigger screen than the 5,5-inch iPhone 8 Plus. The X is comfortable in the hand, and it feels remarkable to have so much more screen real estate than a cumbersome ‚Äúplus-sized‚Äù phone.¬†Our Youtube Channel can be viewed at the following link.

influenster,iphone,"I‚Äôm so in love with this phone! All the little features such as FaceID, not showing a preview of a text unless it knows its you looking at the screen, not dimming when you are reading something and the sound quality is such a big difference alongside the brightness (I have mines just below half way now and it‚Äôs just as bright as my old iPhone when it was up full!). I also am a big lover of the True Tone setting, and don't get me started on the camera! It is so crisp and clean and takes wonderful photos, it‚Äôs like having my DSLR in my pocket! It only took me a day to get used to not having a home button and now when I‚Äôm on my iPod Touch (I use for music), I go to swipe up to open it as well! Also really love the control centre and how you can customise what controls you want displayed there. It really is Apples best phone yet!",5

influenster,iphone,"First of all I love Apple ! Every year I change my cel phone but this product is perfect . The quality of the photo it‚Äôs perfect , and I love to take pictures, I recommend to other for sure . The price it‚Äôs a little expensive, but worth it for the quality .",5
influenster,iphone,"Love this phone! I have had IPhone for more than 6 years. Is so easy to use and practical. I don‚Äôt change this brand, for me is the best. Photos, videos and battery makes this phone great.",5
influenster,iphone,"I bought this phone on contract a couple of months back. I‚Äôm pretty useless with phones and tend to break them so I was a bit weary about getting the new iPhone. However, I have actually dropped it quite a few times and it surprisingly doesn‚Äôt even have a slight scratch! This phone is extremely lightweight, a good enough size to fit in your pocket. I love the fact that everything works with Face ID especially when I don‚Äôt have the effort to constantly put in my passwords. I‚Äôd say the best thing about this phone is by far the camera. The camera is unbelievable. There are different ways of taking a picture..  portrait, studio etc. The detail in the photos are outstanding. Especially great for me when I love to capture memories every day.Definitely recommend.",5
influenster,iphone,Been loving this since I got it! The portrait mode is amazing! #nofilterneeded it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s easy to use like iPhones before it and the facial recognition is amazing! It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s never been easier for you to unlock your phone while still keeping your information safe!,5
influenster,iphone,Top phone ever made. Not having a home button was really easy to get used to. Sturdy and an amazing camera. So easy to use and very reliable. Really recommend even if it is very expensive. Much better than the google pixel. :),5
influenster,iphone,"With iPhone X, the device is the screen. It is the all-new Super Retina size 5.8 inches that fills the hand and satietyWe used new technology and techniques to perfectly harmonize the screen with the streamlined design to the corners with its elegant curves.The first OLED display rises to the iPhone level, featuring stunning accurate colors and a more realistic display of black color scores, plus high brightness and a 1,000,000: 1 contrast ratio.A small space containing some of the most important technologyYour face is now your password. Face ID provides a new, secure and confidential way to unlock and verify your device.The rear cameras feature optical stabilization of images and quick lenses for superb photos and videos, even in lowlight",5
influenster,iphone,This phone is amazing! It is expensive but the camera quality is incredible. It comes with a lot of storage too which is nice and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s really easy to use! Definitely met my expectations and I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t regret purchasing!,5
influenster,iphone,"My husband has the iPhone X, I decided to go for the 8 Plus. First of all, it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a home button which makes it a bit tricky to use (you can make a virtual home button, idk how but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s on YouTube). The idea of the Face ID is not bad, I just think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s creepy that your phone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s watching you all the damn time. The screen is much bigger than a Plus√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢, although the phone is smaller. If you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t decide which one to go for, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d recommend you to buy the 8, because the camera is literally the same and everything else is pretty much the same. Also, my husband√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s phone keeps crashing, mine is fine √∞≈∏‚Äò≈í",3
influenster,iphone,Mi nombre es Rosal√É¬≠ y estoy empezando como Youtuber me encantar√É¬≠a dar mi opini√É¬≥n cr√É¬≠tica sobre este Iphone para aumentar suscriptores y sensibilizar a mis suscriptores que este aparato es el mejor de todos.,5
influenster,iphone,"Apple deliberately saved its high-end features for the iPhone X and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s unlike anything it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s released before.It has the largest screen of any iPhone, at 5.8in and it stretches from edge to edge like those seen on the¬†Samsung Galaxy S8and¬†Galaxy Note 8. This screen is Apple√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s first foray into OLED displays, too, and to fit the larger screen onto the device the home button has been ditched. Instead, there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a 'notch' that houses the phone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Face ID camera (more on which later). You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d imagine this might make the handset feel large, but by maximising screen size without increasing the size of the handset, the iPhone X feels smaller than the iPhone 8 Plus. In fact, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s closer in design and feel to the original iPhone than any of its recent predecessors.",5

influenster,iphone,"I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t had an iPhone in forever, so when my previous phone, an android died out after a fatal fall, I decided to splurge on this. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m happy and satisfied; however, I do feel there are better phones on market that cost much less. The camera MP itself is shit, but the way apple has set up the app and what you can do with the camera is superb. The battery lasts all day long and more. I do find it easier to game on androids and certain apps run smoother. However, if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re into only social media and selfies, this is an excellent phone. I love that the whole front is screen and the phone is made of glass. Colors are vivid on screen. It has many nice and useful features. It has a nice sleek look. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a good size for even my small hands to hold and take a selfie. If you tend to use earphones often, you may not like this phone as you can only connect the charger or the earphones at a time. I wish the buttons were all on one side only. The phone connects easily to car via Bluetooth. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve dropped this already and had no cracks on the phone, case, or glass screen protector.",4
influenster,iphone,"Ok, ok, ok I have many things to say but I will make a brief summary.Let's talk about the iPhone X, this is a very good high-end device, the camera is simply amazing, with it you can get professional photography results without the need to buy a camera, with your camera in addition to obtaining spectacular results when making a professional photo, you can capture the most beautiful and funny in a very peculiar way. Its large 5.8-inch screen offers the owner a great comfort when holding it, its rounded corners are so elegant and perfect. His design in a few words is simply ""Perfect"", a thing that I also liked a lot was that they made a phone resistant to dust and water. Its graphics are great, work excellent with the best games in 4K UHD, its HDR screen makes the colors have a sharpness and definition very good. This phone for me is ""Perfect"", the only bad thing about this device is that it takes a bit longer than normal to export videos in 4K. And well this has been my criticism about the amazing iPhone X.",5

influenster,iphone,"I‚Äôm seriously crushing on the new Apple iPhone X.I would LOVE to get one of these from Santa this year but I think I might be on his naughty list üòùWith its Face ID and voice recognition, it‚Äôs faster and smarter than it‚Äôs predecessors. You can also send an Animoji of yourself in messages, can‚Äôt wait to play with that function.....Edge to edge, corner to corner screen makes it so very appealing to the eye........Wireless charging would make life so much simpler, no more being tied to the wall........And with all that screen, you‚Äôd expect nothing less than it being dust and water resistant. Which means good things for those miserable English days and nights and when it simply won‚Äôt stop raining!!My crush on the iPhone X is because of all the above reasons, who wouldn‚Äôt want a phone that can pretty much do everything?! Having one of these would make writing reviews and taking pictures and shooting videos so much more of an enjoyable experience. I enjoy what I do now but feel like I‚Äôm only in little league on my current phone.",5

influenster,iphone,"I‚Äôve been using my iPhone X now for a couple weeks and am really liking it. I upgraded from an iPhone 7 and it took no time to get used to not having a home button. I‚Äôm actually kind of surprised that I adapted so quickly, they made it very intuitive. I had heard a lot of negative reviews about the ‚Äònotch‚Äô at the top of the screen and I‚Äôm sure for some people it would be annoying or inconvenient depending on the type of activity you‚Äôre using your phone for but I haven‚Äôt noticed any frustrations with it at all. I hated texting or typing on my iPhone 7 as the keyboard went right to the bottom of the phone and I found that my thumb knuckles would really start to hurt as I had to really torque my thumbs down the screen to type while holding my phone. Thankfully, I don‚Äôt seem to notice the same issue with this new iPhone X as they seem to have moved the keyboard up the screen slightly. Very happy with this phone so far!",5
influenster,iphone,From An iPhone 7+ To iPhone X There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Not Much Of A Big Difference Other Than The Obvious Design Of The Phone And The Camera Quality. It Takes A Bit Of Getting Used To The Layout Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t Much Different. However I Do Prefer The iPhone 7+/8+ If Your Clumsy I Wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t Recommend This Phone As It Is Glass And Deserves To Be Handled With Care. Other Than That The Phone Is Alright ! Apple iPhone X,4

I am loving FaceID - it can also be used for things like internet banking, which is great. Also, the camera is amazing quality and selfies look great with the new portrait mode.The only thing I can fault is that the lack of the home button can make closing the apps fully a little bit more awkward than on previous models, however this is only because I would always fully close an app as soon as I was done with it.",5
influenster,iphone,Just like every other iPhone it is probably the best phone that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s out at the moment. Maybe not due to hardware but the user experience just keeps getting better. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all that matters to me.

influenster,iphone,"I was pretty excited to get the phone, but was also hesitant.

I had very little issues with switching to it. No problem at all with Face ID. The only thing I am not really a fan of is changing to app view and closing the apps out.

influenster,iphone,This is my first time ever owning an iPhone and I have found the transition from Android to IPhone has been easy. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in love with this phone especially the camera and recording capabilities and options. I have read about some issues with the phone and pray that I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t encounter them because the phone is a major financial investment. I have had it for two weeks now and it has frozen up on me which was scary and concerning but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not giving up on it yet. Hopefully that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t happen again because I love the phone!,4
influenster,iphone,"I recently upgraded from an iPhone 6 to the iPhone X. I absolutely love it! It took me a while to adjust to the home button and headphone jack being gone, but once I did, it was a breeze! The phone's processor is much faster, so it doesn't lag out. I LOVE how much better the camera quality is. The screen display is also much clearer with way better definition. And the battery life is a HUGE improvement... I only have to charge my phone every other day now instead of daily. The device itself is also very thin and lightweight.

influenster,iphone,"The X is simply breathtaking. It is a break from the iPhones that we have become used to, with new gestures, features, etc. The X is FAST and the touch screen is silky smooth. On paper the 8 and X do not look that different but touch and feel wise there is a difference. The camera on the X is simply amazing with built-in optical image stabilization on both camera/focal lengths. The detail is crisp and sharp. This truly rivals a DLSR camera. Music play on the X is better also, maybe its the sexiness of the phone but it is louder.",5

Phone freezes sometimes 4. Phone constantly logs me out of accounts even if I was just on it . 5. Headset that came with the phone broke after using it a few times.

influenster,iphone,"You have no idea how much I love Apple, but sincerely the IphoneX disengaged me, its camera is fantastic is something that I have to accept, the photos that I take with the great som, however it has something that bothers me a lot, and that is that when I'm in an app it closes instantly and that happens from the first day I acquired it, it has many internal errors, but the design is amazing.

influenster,iphone,I could say that the¬† Apple iPhone X is quite expensive but is an amazing phone to use. My father has the phone and he adores it so do I. It meet my expectations 100% and I would totally want to buy it for myself. The best feature is the The Face ID that is so safe and security wise. I would totally recommend this product.¬†Oh! And the camera quality is TO DIE FOR.,5
influenster,iphone,"The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, but one that really paid off. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got.¬†The OLED display goes a long way in making amends for these quibbles. The 5.8-inch screen has a 2,436 x 1,125-pixel resolution (458 pixels per inch), and it‚Äôs razor sharp. Colors are vibrant, blacks are finally as pitch-dark as many other OLED Android phones, and it was easy to read in direct sunlight. ¬†You‚Äôll have a hard time pulling your eyes away from this screen.¬†As on the iPhone 8 and iPad, Apple‚Äôs True Tone technology detects the lighting condition you‚Äôre in, and adjusts the screen‚Äôs tint to make it more readable. It works extremely well, and made the screen warmer ‚Äî and easier on the eyes ‚Äî in our harsh office lighting.The phone‚Äôs all-glass rear is almost the same as the iPhone 8 Plus, except the dual-camera setup has turned to a vertical orientation. Apple says the front-facing depth sensors and cameras took up a lot of space up top, and the rear camera wouldn‚Äôt fit sideways. With only the Apple and iPhone logo printed on the glass, the back looks minimal and sleek. The vertical orientation is a dead giveaway you have the iPhone X, as it‚Äôs a pretty unusual camera orientation and placement on a phone.One noticeable difference is the power button, which now perhaps should be called the ‚Äúlock button.‚Äù Still situated on the right edge, it‚Äôs more elongated than before, which makes it easier to find and press. We say lock button because to turn off the iPhone X, you need to press the lock button and the volume up or down buttons. Tapping on the lock button just wakes or turns off your screen, but you can double tap it to activate Apple Pay, or press and hold it to launch Siri.The mute switch is on the top left, and the volume rocker sits below. There‚Äôs still no headphone jack, and the only port is for your Lightning cable at the bottom edge, between the bottom-firing speakers. For music, you‚Äôll either have to pair wireless earbuds with the¬†Bluetooth 5 technology¬†on board, or you can embrace the dongle life with the included Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter.What I like most about the iPhone X is its size. It feels compact ‚Äî it‚Äôs slightly larger than the 4.7-inch iPhone 8, but it has a bigger screen than the 5,5-inch iPhone 8 Plus. The X is comfortable in the hand, and it feels remarkable to have so much more screen real estate than a cumbersome ‚Äúplus-sized‚Äù phone.",5

But it also great for traveling.¬†The functions are so detailed that you doesn't need to bring other heavy gadget along while traveling.¬†¬†This is where i want to keep my most precious memories. With unlimited photos and videos of families, friends and places.My #GiftCrush that I'm hoping to get is the Iphone X.¬†As you noticed that there a tonnes of a poaitive review about the latest Iphone. What with the Face Unlock System and others. But impacted me more to choose this phone is that, the quality of the camera. The images that its capture and the details of it.¬†I love travelling. But what i hate the most is the bulky gadget that i need to bring along. Sometimes i spent half of my luggage for my camera stuff. The tripod, battery, the lense and even the camera itself is bigger than others.¬†With this brand new iphone. Not only I bring along 1 items for all. It saves me a space on my luggage. It hassle free, no more hit someone else accidentally when bringing my big bulky tripod. I just bring my phone stand. And tadaaa.

Esta demasuadi hermoso:( LO QUIERO",5
influenster,iphone,"What i love about the Iphone X is that it's not only suitable for normal day usage. But it also great for traveling. The functions are so detailed that you doesn't need to bring other heavy gadget along while traveling.  This is where i want to keep my most precious memories. With unlimited photos and videos of families, friends and places.My #GiftCrush that I'm hoping to get is the Iphone X. As you noticed that there a tonnes of a poaitive review about the latest Iphone. What with the Face Unlock System and others. But impacted me more to choose this phone is that, the quality of the camera. The images that its capture and the details of it. I love travelling. But what i hate the most is the bulky gadget that i need to bring along. Sometimes i spent half of my luggage for my camera stuff. The tripod, battery, the lense and even the camera itself is bigger than others. With this brand new iphone. Not only I bring along 1 items for all. It saves me a space on my luggage. It hassle free, no more hit someone else accidentally when bringing my big bulky tripod. I just bring my phone stand. And tadaaa. As simple as ABC.I want this Iphone so badly that I try surveyed it in my country. Unfortunately the price is a bit higher that i expected for a medium salary person like me. If only i can get this as a gift. It will make my whole years feel like dancing in the rain. ELATEDLY HAPPYApple iPhone X",5

influenster,iphone,I think the only reason we're buying it because of it is a luxury statement. There are very little difference from the older iphones. And is the only smartphone that does the bokeh mode right which is a üëç. Good camera but nothing else,2
influenster,iphone,"The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, but one that really paid off. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got.it is a perfect phone buy it",5

influenster,iphone,"The iphone x launch was an incredibly risky one but Apple somehow made it successful. We all needed a change from the same boring looking gadgets and iphone x was just the right choice. Although expensive the latest iphone offers face id which enables animoji which is short for animated emoji, a fster processor and a better camera for all the techies out there. My experience with iphone x is kind of a mixed reaction where on one hand i love the features but on the other i hate taking my phone out in public in fear of flexing. The face id is kind of a fail cause my sister is sometimes able to open my phone even without knowing the passcode and the no earphones jack thing is annoying which brings me to my next point. The x has passed the drop test successfully without the glass body shattering entirely and the water test where it was submerged 20 ft down a river and still survived. Despite apple saying it can only survive 1m, it surpassed our expectations and went 6.67 m which is incredible. This technology gives us hope that in the future we can get our flying cars which we were promised a decade ago and that humanity is definitely evolving not reversing as whole.",5

influenster,iphone,"I bought this phone after my brand new 8 plus was stolen. I was not a fan at first which is why I did not choose it over my 8+ but the smaller size did grow on me. The lack of home button and face recognition took a bit to get used to but comes in handy especially when you're cooking and can't wipe your hands right away to unlock your phone.¬†The screen delivers crisp and clear video quality that is like a dream. I use my phone a lot for drone flying and quick videos when I'm traveling without needing to carry a DSLR or other heavy equipment for about the same quality. Would not choose the XS over the X but if you're upgrading from below an 8, then the XS could be the phone for you.",4

But I would say that if it is worth paying because the phone has new features such as facial unlocking, emojis, the camera is super good and the design is super cute to the only thing that I do not get used to is that it does not have the button if not that it is with the finger all",5

It may not recognise you if you wrap in scarf and hat, but generally it does a good job!

There were close to 300 people waiting and the store would only let a few of us in at a time.The BIGGEST thing I noticed was 3 customers while I was there asking if they could change from the Space Grey to the Silver because it looked so much better. It is simply just stunning. AHHHHHHHHHHHIf you guys have any questions you quickly want answered, let me know and I'll check for you.

influenster,iphone,"Apple iPhone XI love almost everything about this phone, but before I begin I must say that I do miss the home button. It‚Äôs on the pricey side but I must say I love apple products. The camera takes out really great pics, both front and back. The graphics is amazing. The overall finishing a on the iPhone X is really crisp and elegant.",4
influenster,iphone,"Apple has been coasting for too long with the design it introduced for the iPhone 6, but that all changes with the iPhone X ‚Äì in a big way. You don‚Äôt need me to tell you the iPhone X is a huge departure from the iPhone design of old ‚Äì just look at the pictures. Not only does it look good, however; Apple has done a fantastic job at actually making it feel really good too.¬† This phone is simply gorgeous. It‚Äôs slightly taller than the¬†iphone 8¬†and 7 and 6 but much narrower and smaller than the iPhone 8 Plus. It strikes the perfect balance, especially since you‚Äôre getting a 5.8-inch display .The aluminium sides have been swapped out for stainless steel ‚Äì as seen on the¬†Apple Watch¬†‚Äì and the front and rear of the device are glass. I received the Silver variant for review ‚Äì and, unfortunately, it wasn‚Äôt long before it was covered in fingerprints, those shiny sides being a particular magnet. This is a phone that looks fantastic straight after a wipe-down; not so much a few hours after it‚Äôs been in your greasy palms.Also of concern is how the iPhone X will fare over time. No matter how unscientific they might be, drop tests indicate that the finish here doesn‚Äôt lend itself well to wear and tear. After all, the stainless steel Apple Watch I‚Äôve been using is a scratched-up mess. As a result, my iPhone X has spent much of its time inside an Apple case, but this certainly sees it lose points in the glamour stakes.iPhone X 64GB ‚Äì 15GB, ¬£42pm, ¬£250 upfront on O2 (use code TRUSTED10 to save ¬£10)Alternatively,",5

influenster,iphone,"One of the best apple products yet such great camera quality for pictures or YouTube videos the price is quite high honestly but depends on you, it‚Äôs very pricey and both front and back are glass so it can crack easily if it falls but if you weigh the pros and cons you could decide from there what you need it for",5

influenster,iphone,"I love iPhones. I was skeptical about this version. But I love the edge to edge screen. The notch isn't the greatest but it's manageable. I do miss the home button but the swipe isnt so bad. Aside from that, the price is a bit too high but the glass back is a great throwback to the old version.",4

influenster,iphone,"The good The iPhone X delivers a great blend of handheld comfort and a big, gorgeous 5.8-inch OLED screen. The rear-facing telephoto camera outshoots the iPhone 8 Plus in low light, and the front-facing camera snaps impressive portrait mode selfies. Face ID generally works fine.The bad The iPhone X is nearly certain to be replaced by a newer, better model in less than 3 months, but remains hella expensive in the meantime. The all-glass body means a case and an insurance plan are musts. Shorter battery life than iPhone 8 Plus.",5

influenster,iphone,"The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, but one that really paid off. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got.it is a perfect phone buy it",5

influenster,iphone,"What i love about the Iphone X is that it's not only suitable for normal day usage. But it also great for traveling.¬†The functions are so detailed that you doesn't need to bring other heavy gadget along while traveling.¬†¬†This is where i want to keep my most precious memories. With unlimited photos and videos of families, friends and places.My #GiftCrush that I'm hoping to get is the Iphone X.¬†As you noticed that there a tonnes of a poaitive review about the latest Iphone. What with the Face Unlock System and others. But impacted me more to choose this phone is that, the quality of the camera. The images that its capture and the details of it.¬†I love travelling. But what i hate the most is the bulky gadget that i need to bring along. Sometimes i spent half of my luggage for my camera stuff. The tripod, battery, the lense and even the camera itself is bigger than others.¬†With this brand new iphone. Not only I bring along 1 items for all. It saves me a space on my luggage. It hassle free, no more hit someone else accidentally when bringing my big bulky tripod. I just bring my phone stand. And tadaaa. As simple as ABC.I want this Iphone so badly that I try surveyed it in my country. Unfortunately the price is a bit higher that i expected for a medium salary person like me. If only i can get this as a gift. It will make my whole years feel like dancing in the rain. ELATEDLY HAPPY",5

Must admit, I still can‚Äôt fault them. They have to be the best phone out there as gadget wise. It‚Äôs improved a hell of a lot over time and it keeps me occupied all day long with the great apps that the App Store provides and all of the music too. Sound quality with out headset is fab!!! I hardly ever now use my Bluetooth speakers because the sound is so good. What I love about the features now, are the touch senses when you unlock your phone, it‚Äôs fab!!! Camera is great!!!

I love the Face ID - it works every time! I upgraded from a 6s therefore I have benefitted greatly from the iPhone X. However, I do wonder whether this phone is actually worth ¬£1,000. I personally feel the price is too high. Furthermore, I was greatly disappointed that when watching YouTube videos the full screen does not get used - it gets cut to resemble an old iPhone screen. Nevertheless, overall I‚Äôm very happy with the iPhone X and have had no problems upon use.",4

influenster,iphone,"I know that I‚Äôm not the only one that likes apple products, but I know that I love them just as much as they do. I have the iPhone 7 right now and I love it so much. I have been an Apple fan ever since I got the iPod touch 4th generation. I‚Äôve had the IPod touch, IPad mini 4, Mac Book Air, and IPhone SE before the iPhone 7. I‚Äôm the types of person that loves taking pictures. Every time I‚Äôm at my cottage I‚Äôm always taking pictures of the lake. I love the camera on this phone, it‚Äôs so clear. The size of the phone is nice but it‚Äôs a little too small for my hands. I‚Äôm was little upset that it doesn‚Äôt have the headphone jack but that didn‚Äôt stop me from buying it.  I have had this phone since August 13th 2017 (My Birthday) and won‚Äôt get a new phone till 2019. When my contract is up, I will be getting the newest phone that will come out. I used to have a Samsung Galaxy S5 before my SE and it was horrible, mine and my sisters kept crashing so we decided to go to Apple instead of Samsung",5
influenster,iphone,I was really happy with my Iphone X. I had an Iphone 6 before and 16 GB was not enough for my photos apps and videos now I have 64GB storage which is enough for me.

But overall I give it a 5!! :),5
influenster,iphone,"My dad has this phone and I honestly would love to have one myself.1. You get two colours black and silver so beautiful.2.

influenster,iphone,"I had the first iPhone that was out years ago and I loved it. Thought I‚Äôd see what all of the android phones were like before getting another. Must admit, I still can‚Äôt fault them. They have to be the best phone out there as gadget wise. It‚Äôs improved a hell of a lot over time and it keeps me occupied all day long with the great apps that the App Store provides and all of the music too. Sound quality with out headset is fab!!! I hardly ever now use my Bluetooth speakers because the sound is so good. What I love about the features now, are the touch senses when you unlock your phone, it‚Äôs fab!!! Camera is great!!! Overall, iPhone is a winner for me, beats the others I‚Äôve had in the past",5

influenster,iphone,Hola . Lo √∫nico malo que tengo que decir de este maravilloso smartphone es su precio. En mi pa√≠s (Per√∫) est√° como 3000 o 4000 soles. Que es aproximadamente 4 -6 meses trabajando duro con un salario m√≠nimo .,4
influenster,iphone,The iPhone X has always been like a dream because of its crazy design and features. The camera is also the biggest attraction for us girls who love taking selfies and photos! I really hope to own it someday....,5
influenster,iphone,This phone is really modern and the graphics are amazing but it is really expensive. The amazing screen makes watching videos a lot better but it doesn‚Äôt have a button which makes it a lot harder to use.,4
influenster,iphone,this is a good phone. comes with 3d face detection and animojis.it also have some great ar quality but it is not as per the rate. it costs 1000$ to buy this thing which is a little more.,4
influenster,iphone,"The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, but one that really paid off. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got.",5
influenster,iphone,"I want to try this, I want an iPhone, I'm needing this now, iPhone is a good mark of cellphones, I have iPhone 6 normal..... but I want try the iPhone X, this cellphone is so amazing I like so much the camera my best friends have one and is so phenomenal.",5
influenster,iphone,"I love this phone! Apple phones are known for being user friendly, which is why I love them. I‚Äôm not the most tech savvy, so the one Android phone I did own wasn‚Äôt my favorite. I wasn‚Äôt used to the layout of that phone, and I think the iPhone has a very user friendly layout. My grandparents also have this iPhone and it is working well for them. I‚Äôve had this phone for about a year and a half and is still working well for me. Love it! thanks",5

influenster,iphone,"I love iphone . I upgraded from an S4. The camera and screen quality is amazing and the charging is really fast. It was expensive, but we were able to get a buy one/get one free and the only way cell phone carriers operate these days is to finance it over 2 years if you don't want to buy it outright, so the monthly payment for the 2 phones we got is affordable. I would highly recommend this phone. I am a Mac person for just about every other electronic I own, but I switched to Samsung/Android a little over 2 years ago and like them so much more than my iPhone. Every time I was upgrading my iPhone (I went through 3 models, loved my first) they seemed to have more and more glitches and it was very frustrating. I have not looked back since I switched! I was concerned with the Edge and potentially hitting it on accident, but I have not had that problem",5

My review follows this rant.2 years ago rumours started to circulate about this upcoming edge-to-edge fully glassed piece of art, which would be released on the iPhone's 10th anniversary. It would encompass the fastest processor, a 4k camera, 4k AMOLED screen, reality augmentation, new speakers, Face ID, In-screen Touch ID, and proximity wireless charging (a charging station that transmits a charge without contact).If the rumours held true this device would be the king of all Smart phones, no question.",5
